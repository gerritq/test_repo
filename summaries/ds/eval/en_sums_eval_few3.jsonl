Smith, 1855)\n\n== Morphology ==\nWorkers are yellow, orange, or brown. They are slender with large eyes, short antennal scapes and a well-developed sting. Head widths measure 0.68–0.89 millimeters. The surface of the head is shiny, due to the lack of a fine hairy covering. Workers of P. pallidus are monomorphic.\n\nBoth virgin female and male reproductives are winged. Mated queens in the nest can be identified by scars on their thorax where the wings were previously attached. They can also be identified by their distended gasters. Males are dark brown, with curved antennae and small heads.\n\n== Habitat ==\nNests of this species are found in the hollow stems of dead grasses. Although they show a preference for herbaceous plants, nests have also been found in the dead stems of woody twigs. Nests are generally found at the intersection of grassy and wooded habitats, possibly due to shading from the canopy in warmer months and exposure to sunlight in colder months. The entrance to the colony consists of a round to oblong entrance measuring 1–2 mm (0.04–0.08 in) on the face of the stem, and can easily be plugged by the body of a single worker to prevent access to the brood by predators. Stems containing P. pallidus are 5–10 mm (0.20–0.39 in) in diameter, and the excavated chambers are 11.8–72 cm (4.6–28.3 in) long.\n\n== Diet ==\nColonies reared in the laboratory will readily accept sucrose solution and dead insect parts as a food source, which suggest that their diet in the field consist of floral secretions such as nectar, and insect prey. Food stores are not found in nests collected in the field, neither are they found in colonies raised in laboratory observation nests. This implies that any food brought into the nest is directly fed to nestmates and larvae.\n\n== Colony structure ==\nColonies are facultatively polygynous, consisting of 1–15 queen ants and 20–200 workers. Colonies are also polydomous, where a colony consists of more than one nest site. Queenless colonies containing only brood and workers have been found, suggesting that these function as auxiliary brood rearing sites. Workers are produced throughout the year, as are reproductive females. However, males appear to only be produced during the summer and the fall seasons, as they are absent from nests collected in the winter.\n\n== Mating ==\nReproductive females can be collected from colonies throughout the year, which indicates that mating occurs in more than one season. There is no specific information on the mating habits of P. pallidus.\"\"\""}

During the Armenian genocide she lost her parents and was taken, along with her elder sister, to a Protestant orphanage in Smyrne. Then she moved to Corinth, Greece. After 1926 she lived in Marseilles, France, where she learned French and studied accounting. She met her future husband Missak Manouchian in 1934. In 1935 she became secretary of the Armenian Relief Committee. She was in close contact with Charles Aznavour's family. According to Aida Aznavour, the Manouchians \"during the long years — and what years! — played an outstanding role in the life of our family\". During the French Resistance she became a heroic companion to her husband. She \"posed incognito at the scene of a guerilla attack to observe carefully the movements of each actor and note the results of the operation and the reaction of the public\". From the early 1940s she regularly made, copied and distributed forbidden anti-fascist literature. When Missak was arrested for the first time, she asked Micha Aznavourian to take her to the camp at Compiègne on his bicycle. She succeeded in passing some food to her husband (prisoner number 351) and even visited him for a second.\n\nAfter the last arrest of Missak, she was sentenced to death in absentia, but was hidden and saved by the Aznavourians.

In particular, Manouchian accused Boris Holban of being the man responsible for her husband's arrest, claiming that he refused her husband's request to locate the FTP-MOI group out of Paris and threatened to have him shot as a deserter if did leave Paris. The American scholar Brett Bowles noted that Mosco Boucault,, the film's director, went out of his way to portray Manouchian in the most favorable light possible. Bowles noted that in the film: \"Visually, Mélinée’s appearance, body language, and the interview site all suggest generosity, candor, and truthfulness. Wearing a brown long sleeve sweater and flowered blouse open at the neck, she sits comfortably in the living room of her modest apartment on an overstuffed chair with legs uncrossed and looks directly into the camera as she speaks, occasionally pumping her hands for emphasis\". Furthermore, Boucault shot a series of close-ups of Manouchian's face and was very sympathetic in his questions to her, in marked contrast to the accusatory tone he took in his interview with Holban.

At the same time, the lack of representation of female artists on country radio and at country music festivals had been publicly discussed by many journalists like Marissa Moss. While on tour in her van, Shires kept a running list of artists while listening to country radio, and noticed that there were very few women. When she called to request they play more female artists, she was directed to a Facebook page lottery system. Cobb recommended Shires call Carlile, who she didn't know. Carlile thought it would be fun, and would be an interesting creative project.\n\nThe Highwomen project was widely hinted at by Carlile, Morris and Shires before it was officially announced on April 6, 2019. The Highwomen had originally intended to leave the fourth spot in their line-up vacant to allow other female collaborators to join them, with Chely Wright, Courtney Marie Andrews, Margo Price, Janelle Monáe, and Sheryl Crow mentioned as potential guests. The band, who jokingly refer to the collaboration as a pirate ship experience, said that they see the project as an incubator project that highlights mentorship and support of fellow women artists.\n\nThe group made their live debut on April 1, 2019, at Loretta Lynn's 87th birthday concert held at the Bridgestone Arena in Nashville. There, Natalie Hemby was officially revealed as the final member and the quartet performed \"It Wasn't God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels\".\n\n== Release and promotion ==\nThe album was officially announced on July 19, 2019, with the release of the album's first single, \"Redesigning Women\", along with the album's pre-order. The music video for \"Redesigning Women\" was released the same day. The promotional single, \"Crowded Table\", was released on July 26. On July 30, the Highwomen appeared on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon where they performed \"Redesigning Women\" and \"Crowded Table\". In July 2019, the Highwomen performed their first ever full live set at the 60th annual Newport Folk Festival, previewing songs from their upcoming album. The third and final promotional single \"Highwomen\", was released on August 13.\n\n== Content ==\nThe album opens with \"Highwomen\", a re-written version of the Jimmy Webb penned classic, \"Highwayman\". The song was re-written by band members Brandi Carlile and Amanda Shires with Webb's blessing. Together they created the story of the band in classic response-song style. The song tells the story of how women throughout history have often sacrificed themselves for something greater. The four women in the song are an immigrant, a healer, a freedom rider, and a preacher. It features guest vocals from Yola and background vocals from Sheryl Crow. The album's second track, and lead single, is \"Redesigning Women\". It was written by band member Natalie Hemby with Rodney Clawson. Rolling Stone said that the song \"puts a woman’s experience front and center, with just enough punch to make it smart, self-deprecating, and sarcastic all at once.\" The third track, \"Loose Change\", written by band member Maren Morris with Maggie Chapman and Daniel Layus of the band Augustana, is filled with clever wordplay and a heavy dose of Texas swagger. \"Crowded Table\", the fourth track and second single, was written by band members Hemby and Carlile with Lori McKenna. Rolling Stone called the song the band's mission statement and said it's about \"looking for a world where everyone is given a chance to fit in. This isn’t about leaning in or fighting for the top chair. It’s about making room.\"\n\nTrack five, \"My Name Can't Be Mama\" was written by Carlile, Morris, and Shires. An inclusive song about motherhood and parenting, it is equal parts funny and potent. The three women in the song all have their own definition of being a mother and each have their own reason for why they need a break. For Carlile, it's a hard morning after a night of no sleep; for Shires, it's trying to find a career; and for Morris, it's a break from society's expectation to have children by a certain age. \"If She Ever Leaves Me\", the album's sixth track, was written by band member Amanda Shires with her husband Jason Isbell and Chris Thompkins. Isbell said that he came up with the idea while exercising and realized that if Carlile sang it they could have a singular \"gay country song\" moment. Rolling Stone called it \"a love song that transcends sexuality while not ignoring it.\"\n\nTrack seven, \"Old Soul\", penned by Morris with Luke Dick and Laura Veltz, is an intimate look at the burdens of having to grow up too fast. The eighth track, \"Don't Call Me\", written by Shires and Peter Levin, is a reminder to not pick up the phone the next time an ex calls. \"My Only Child\", the album's ninth track, was written by members Hemby and Shires with Miranda Lambert. It is about the love a mother has for her child and her disappointment that her family ended up smaller than she had once dreamed it would. The album's tenth track, \"Heaven Is a Honky Tonk\", was written by members Carlile and Hemby with Ray LaMontagne, and features Sheryl Crow and background vocals by Yola. Track eleven, \"Cocktail and a Song\", is a solo composition from Shires about mortality and life's inevitabilities. The album closes with \"The Wheels of Laredo\", a song written by Carlile with Tim and Phil Hanseroth for Tanya Tucker's 2019 album, While I'm Livin'.\n\n== Critical reception ==\nThe album received mostly positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received a weighted average score of 80 based on 13 reviews.\n\nChris Willman from Variety called the album an \"instant classic,\" and went on to say that \"the all-star foursome has put together an album full of high comedy and high pathos, zingy group-sings and gut-wreching solo turns, wryness and rue, and harmony co-existing with this strange and nearly forgotten thing called twang.\" Laura Stanley at Exclaim! gave the album an 8 out of 10, and said the album \"is both a call for change and a celebration of women in country music.\" Writing for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album four out of five stars and said, \"The record's resonance lies in its deep emotions and sense of craft. The craft isn't incidental, either. Their shared skills as writers and singers provide the supporting evidence to Shires' conceptual thesis: if country radio doesn't want to play music this good, what's the point of radio anyway?\" Will Hermes from Rolling Stone gave the album four out of five stars. His review said, \"What’s most impressive about The Highwomen, handsomely produced with Nashville neoclassicist Dave Cobb, is how artfully, and matter-of-factly, it engages social issues. Credit the concentration of songwriting talent. Every woman here is at the top of her game.\" The album received seven out of ten stars from Chris Conaton at PopMatters who said, \"They're having a lot of fun, but the specifically feminist bent of the group's outlook helps focus the album as well. The Highwomen is worth a listen for any fans of these artists individually or as a sampler for all of them.\"\n\nSeth Wilson from Slant Magazine gave the album three and a half out of five stars. He praised the album's title track, calling it \"a powerful and succinct recalibration of Jimmy Webb’s \"The Highwayman\". The album received three and a half out of five stars from Hal Horowitz at American Songwriter. He said the album is \"generally more subdued than the Lambert-led Pistol Annies and less groundbreaking than Trio. It would have helped if all four women participated in every performance since at least one is MIA on the majority of tunes.\" He criticized Dave Cobb's production, calling it \"professional\" but \"also a little dry.\" In a review for Glide Magazine, Jim Hynes said the album \"has its strong moments and it does carry a strong mission. Yet, its ambitious and inclusive scope creates an enormity that somewhat weighs it down.\" In a mixed review for The Guardian, Michael Hann gave the album three out of five stars and said, \"Four voices aren’t always stronger than one, and the collegiate nature of the record leaves one yearning for a little more single-mindedness.\" Nicholas Hautman from Us Weekly gave the album four stars and called it an \"instant classic.\"\n\nThe album won the International Album of the Year award at the 2020 UK Americana Music Awards.\n\n== Commercial performance ==\nThe Highwomen debuted at number 10 on the US Billboard 200 with 34,000 album-equivalent units, including 29,000 pure album sales.

It would have helped if all four women participated in every performance since at least one is MIA on the majority of tunes.\" He criticized Dave Cobb's production, calling it \"professional\" but \"also a little dry.\" In a review for Glide Magazine, Jim Hynes said the album \"has its strong moments and it does carry a strong mission. Yet, its ambitious and inclusive scope creates an enormity that somewhat weighs it down.\" In a mixed review for The Guardian, Michael Hann gave the album three out of five stars and said, \"Four voices aren’t always stronger than one, and the collegiate nature of the record leaves one yearning for a little more single-mindedness.\" Nicholas Hautman from Us Weekly gave the album four stars and called it an \"instant classic.\"\n\nThe album won the International Album of the Year award at the 2020 UK Americana Music Awards.\n\n== Commercial performance ==\nThe Highwomen debuted at number 10 on the US Billboard 200 with 34,000 album-equivalent units, including 29,000 pure album sales. It sold 8,100 copies in the second week. It has sold 86,100 copies in the United States as of March 2020.\n\n== Personnel ==\nAdapted from the album liner notes.\"\"\""}

A Roman villa was located at the site of the later village in the 2nd century, and a small Roman fort was built in the early 4th century to protect the military road from Vindonissa to Augusta Raurica (extended in AD 370). A Roman settlement developed in the vicinity of the fort, replaced by an Alemannic settlement during the 6th to 9th centuries. The Alemannic settlement had a fortified church, the foundations are still visible near the current village church. The name of the village was taken from that of the encompassing region of Frickgau (mentioned as Frichgowe in 926), from a Vulgar Latin [regio] ferraricia, in reference to the iron mine located here in the Roman era (a formation based on Latin ferrāria \"iron mine\" with the -icius suffix), whence early Romance *Ferrícia, Old High German *Ferríkkea, recorded as Fricho in the 11th century.\n\nStarting in the High Middle Ages, Frickgau was owned by the Counts of Homberg-Thierstein. Later, around 1230, it passed to the House of Habsburg, and was overseen by Habsburg ministeriales, known as the lords of Frick, with Gipf, Upper Frick part of Oeschgen, forming the Frick bailiwick (Vogtei) (also called the Homburgeramt). The Homburger Vogt (reeve) was also chief administrator the Fricktal region. The bailiwick was granted special privileges, including the right to elect their reeve, as well as the rights of lower jurisdiction.\n\nThe population of the bailiwick were divided into the upper layer of Vollbauern (\"full farmers\"), as well as in the Halbbauern (\"half-farmers\", i.e. smallholding farmers) and the Taun (tenants). The Vollbauern included the reeve's family, and were the most privileged. The tenants formed the lowest stratum, with no citizen rights, and represented the largest group numerically in the early modern period.\n\nAfter the Act of Mediation in 1803, Frick and the rest of the modern Fricktal became part of the newly formed Canton of Aargau. In 1804 the municipalities of Frick and Gipf-Frick were formed. In 2007 a major dinosaur graveyard was discovered in Frick. Some of the bones, including a complete Plateosaurus, are now on display in the Sauriermuseum.\n\nThe Church of St. Peter and Paul were probably built as a private church for the Counts of Homberg during the High Middle Ages. In the Thirty Years War, the village was destroyed together with the church. In the mid-14th century the church came under the authority of Steinen Convent in Basel. Then, in 1492 it was granted to Teutonic Knights at Beuggen. The present baroque building is from 1716, and the reformed church is from 1910. The reformed parish comprises ten municipalities and the parish offices are in Frick and Gipf-Oberfrick. The catholic parish, consisting of Frick and Gipf-Oberfrick, has been a separate parish since 1953.\n\nThe municipal coat of arms, Argent a Wolf salient Gules, was introduced in 1931 based on the historical coat of arms of the Habsburg ministeriales. Before 1931, Frick had used the coat of arms of Fricktal, a green linden leaf in a white field.\n\nIn 2013 and 2014 it became the Swiss municipality with the highest crime rate, due to the several thousand offences registered in the context of the improper trading case involving ASE Investment, a company with official seat in Frick.\n\n== Geography ==\nFrick has an area, as of 2009, of 9.96 km2 (3.85 sq mi). Of this area, 4.59 square kilometers (1.77 sq mi) or 46.1% is used for agricultural purposes, while 2.92 square kilometers (1.13 sq mi) or 29.3% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 2.41 square kilometers (0.93 sq mi) or 24.2% is settled (buildings or roads), 0.06 km2 (15 acres) or 0.6% is either rivers or lakes. Over the past two decades (1979/85-2004/09) the amount of land that is settled has increased by 60 ha (150 acres) and the agricultural land has decreased by 59 ha (150 acres).\n\nOf the built up area, industrial buildings made up 4.3% of the total area while housing and buildings made up 9.5% and transportation infrastructure made up 5.6%. Power and water infrastructure as well as other special developed areas made up 2.8% of the area while parks, green belts and sports fields made up 1.9%. 27.9% of the total land area is heavily forested and 1.4% is covered with orchards or small clusters of trees. Of the agricultural land, 26.3% is used for growing crops and 17.1% is pastures, while 2.7% is used for orchards or vine crops. All the water in the municipality is in rivers and streams.\n\nThe municipality is located in the Laufenburg district, located at the meeting of the Bözberg, Staffelegg and Benken Jura passes. It is the central municipality in the Fricktal. It consists of the haufendorf village (an irregular, unplanned and quite closely packed village, built around a central square) of Frick.\n\n== Paleontology ==\nDuring the upper Triassic period, about 210 million years ago, the region around Frick was a dry lowland with flat hills and small depressions. During the rainy season, the depressions filled with water and dinosaurs congregated around the ponds. When they died, their bodies were covered by the mud in the ponds and fossilized, creating rich fossil beds in Frick. The first Plateosaurus fossils were discovered in 1961 and further excavations during the following decades have discovered numerous fossils. In 2006, the only coelophysoidean (a small-sized flesh-eating dinosaur group) fossil in Switzerland, was found by an amateur paleontologist in Frick, in 2019 named Notatesseraeraptor.\n\n== Demographics ==\nFrick has a population (as of December 2020) of 5,629.

It consists of the haufendorf village (an irregular, unplanned and quite closely packed village, built around a central square) of Frick.\n\n== Paleontology ==\nDuring the upper Triassic period, about 210 million years ago, the region around Frick was a dry lowland with flat hills and small depressions. During the rainy season, the depressions filled with water and dinosaurs congregated around the ponds. When they died, their bodies were covered by the mud in the ponds and fossilized, creating rich fossil beds in Frick. The first Plateosaurus fossils were discovered in 1961 and further excavations during the following decades have discovered numerous fossils. In 2006, the only coelophysoidean (a small-sized flesh-eating dinosaur group) fossil in Switzerland, was found by an amateur paleontologist in Frick, in 2019 named Notatesseraeraptor.\n\n== Demographics ==\nFrick has a population (as of December 2020) of 5,629.

In 2009 the rate was only 52.8, in 2010 it was 68, 2011 it was 72, it doubled in 2012 to 175, tripled in 2013 to 598 before dropping slightly in 2014. However, the majority of the crimes are probably financial crimes related to the 2013 scandal in which ASE Investment and Basel Cantonal Bank lost over 100 million CHF due to improper trading. Over 1,500 people were affected, leading to thousands of charges filed in Frick.\n\nDuring the same period, the rate of drug crimes was 12.9 per thousand residents, which is a little higher than the national average but is more than double the cantonal rate (5.0 per thousand).

A Roman villa was located at the site of the later village in the 2nd century, and a small Roman fort was built in the early 4th century to protect the military road from Vindonissa to Augusta Raurica (extended in AD 370). A Roman settlement developed in the vicinity of the fort, replaced by an Alemannic settlement during the 6th to 9th centuries. The Alemannic settlement had a fortified church, the foundations are still visible near the current village church. The name of the village was taken from that of the encompassing region of Frickgau (mentioned as Frichgowe in 926), from a Vulgar Latin [regio] ferraricia, in reference to the iron mine located here in the Roman era (a formation based on Latin ferrāria \"iron mine\" with the -icius suffix), whence early Romance *Ferrícia, Old High German *Ferríkkea, recorded as Fricho in the 11th century.\n\nStarting in the High Middle Ages, Frickgau was owned by the Counts of Homberg-Thierstein. Later, around 1230, it passed to the House of Habsburg, and was overseen by Habsburg ministeriales, known as the lords of Frick, with Gipf, Upper Frick part of Oeschgen, forming the Frick bailiwick (Vogtei) (also called the Homburgeramt). The Homburger Vogt (reeve) was also chief administrator the Fricktal region. The bailiwick was granted special privileges, including the right to elect their reeve, as well as the rights of lower jurisdiction.\n\nThe population of the bailiwick were divided into the upper layer of Vollbauern (\"full farmers\"), as well as in the Halbbauern (\"half-farmers\", i.e. smallholding farmers) and the Taun (tenants). The Vollbauern included the reeve's family, and were the most privileged. The tenants formed the lowest stratum, with no citizen rights, and represented the largest group numerically in the early modern period.\n\nAfter the Act of Mediation in 1803, Frick and the rest of the modern Fricktal became part of the newly formed Canton of Aargau. In 1804 the municipalities of Frick and Gipf-Frick were formed. In 2007 a major dinosaur graveyard was discovered in Frick. Some of the bones, including a complete Plateosaurus, are now on display in the Sauriermuseum.\n\nThe Church of St. Peter and Paul were probably built as a private church for the Counts of Homberg during the High Middle Ages. In the Thirty Years War, the village was destroyed together with the church. In the mid-14th century the church came under the authority of Steinen Convent in Basel. Then, in 1492 it was granted to Teutonic Knights at Beuggen. The present baroque building is from 1716, and the reformed church is from 1910. The reformed parish comprises ten municipalities and the parish offices are in Frick and Gipf-Oberfrick. The catholic parish, consisting of Frick and Gipf-Oberfrick, has been a separate parish since 1953.\n\nThe municipal coat of arms, Argent a Wolf salient Gules, was introduced in 1931 based on the historical coat of arms of the Habsburg ministeriales. Before 1931, Frick had used the coat of arms of Fricktal, a green linden leaf in a white field.\n\nIn 2013 and 2014 it became the Swiss municipality with the highest crime rate, due to the several thousand offences registered in the context of the improper trading case involving ASE Investment, a company with official seat in Frick.\n\n== Geography ==\nFrick has an area, as of 2009, of 9.96 km2 (3.85 sq mi). Of this area, 4.59 square kilometers (1.77 sq mi) or 46.1% is used for agricultural purposes, while 2.92 square kilometers (1.13 sq mi) or 29.3% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 2.41 square kilometers (0.93 sq mi) or 24.2% is settled (buildings or roads), 0.06 km2 (15 acres) or 0.6% is either rivers or lakes. Over the past two decades (1979/85-2004/09) the amount of land that is settled has increased by 60 ha (150 acres) and the agricultural land has decreased by 59 ha (150 acres).\n\nOf the built up area, industrial buildings made up 4.3% of the total area while housing and buildings made up 9.5% and transportation infrastructure made up 5.6%. Power and water infrastructure as well as other special developed areas made up 2.8% of the area while parks, green belts and sports fields made up 1.9%. 27.9% of the total land area is heavily forested and 1.4% is covered with orchards or small clusters of trees. Of the agricultural land, 26.3% is used for growing crops and 17.1% is pastures, while 2.7% is used for orchards or vine crops.

Libby's friend Angela Green offers to look after their four-year-old son Matty so they can spend a romantic weekend sailing. Libby awakens to find blood everywhere and her husband missing. The Coast Guard arrive and find Libby holding a bloody knife.\n\nAlthough Nick's body is not found, Libby is arrested, tried, and convicted of murder. Her motive is assumed to be a $2 million life insurance policy and her alleged knowledge that Nick was under investigation for embezzlement. Not wanting Matty to become a ward of the state, she asks Angela to adopt him while she is in prison. At first, Angela regularly brings Matty to visit his mother, but when the visits cease, Libby tracks Angela to San Francisco and calls her. During their conversation, Nick enters and Matty yells, \"Daddy!\" Libby realizes that Nick faked his death and framed her. After failing to get investigative help, a fellow inmate and former lawyer tells Libby to get paroled for good behavior by falsely claiming remorse for \"killing\" Nick. Once free, Libby can kill Nick with impunity due to the Double Jeopardy Clause in the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n\nAfter six years in prison, Libby is paroled to a halfway house under the supervision of parole officer Travis Lehman, a former law professor whose wife and daughter left him due to his alcoholism. To search for Nick, Libby violates curfew and is caught breaking into Matty's old school on Whidbey Island to get Angela's records. As Lehman takes Libby back to prison via a car ferry, he handcuffs her to his car's door handle. Libby manages to start the car and rams another car into the water, but when Lehman tries to stop her, she drives his car off the ferry. As it sinks, he uncuffs her; she grabs his gun and swims away. She visits her mother who gives her cash and her truck.\n\nLibby uses Angela's Social Security number to learn her address in Colorado. There she hears from Angela's former neighbor that Angela, under a different name, died three years earlier in a natural gas explosion. A picture in the paper reveals a painting by Wassily Kandinsky owned by Nick, which Libby is able to trace to New Orleans through an art gallery. At the gallery, Lehman almost catches her, but she rams his car and destroys it before driving away. She flies to New Orleans and finds Nick running a small luxury hotel under the alias Jonathan Devereaux.\n\nLibby confronts Nick during a fund-raising auction at his hotel and demands he return Matty in exchange for her walking away. Nick claims that he faked his death to avoid prison and provide her and Matty with the insurance money, not believing she would be convicted, and that Angie's death was an accident. Libby scoffs at his lies. During their conversation she sees Lehman arrive at the hotel and walks out. Lehman tells \"Jonathan\" that Libby believes he is her dead ex-husband and informs the local police that she is in the area.\n\nThe next day Libby arranges to meet Nick at Lafayette Cemetery No. 3 (filmed at Lafayette Cemetery No. 1) to take Matty. Nick hires a boy to lure Libby to a mausoleum, where Nick knocks Libby out and locks her in a coffin with a corpse. She shoots the hinges off the coffin lid with Lehman's gun, pushes it off, and escapes. Meanwhile, Lehman is in the office of \"Jonathan\" and notices the Kandinsky artwork that Libby was searching for in the gallery. Now unsure of Libby's guilt, he tells his boss in Washington State to fax him the driver's license for \"Nicholas Parsons\".\n\nLehman intercepts Libby and she breaks down sobbing. He then goes to Nick's hotel, where he reveals to Nick that he knows his true identity. After Lehman agrees to take a bribe of $1 million, Nick admits to \"murdering\" Libby. Libby emerges with Lehman's gun and both she and Lehman tell Nick that she can kill him with impunity because of the double jeopardy rule. However, instead of shooting Nick, she puts a bullet through the Kandinsky.

Not wanting Matty to become a ward of the state, she asks Angela to adopt him while she is in prison. At first, Angela regularly brings Matty to visit his mother, but when the visits cease, Libby tracks Angela to San Francisco and calls her. During their conversation, Nick enters and Matty yells, \"Daddy!\" Libby realizes that Nick faked his death and framed her. After failing to get investigative help, a fellow inmate and former lawyer tells Libby to get paroled for good behavior by falsely claiming remorse for \"killing\" Nick. Once free, Libby can kill Nick with impunity due to the Double Jeopardy Clause in the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n\nAfter six years in prison, Libby is paroled to a halfway house under the supervision of parole officer Travis Lehman, a former law professor whose wife and daughter left him due to his alcoholism.

There she hears from Angela's former neighbor that Angela, under a different name, died three years earlier in a natural gas explosion.

She flies to New Orleans and finds Nick running a small luxury hotel under the alias Jonathan Devereaux.\n\nLibby confronts Nick during a fund-raising auction at his hotel and demands he return Matty in exchange for her walking away. Nick claims that he faked his death to avoid prison and provide her and Matty with the insurance money, not believing she would be convicted, and that Angie's death was an accident. Libby scoffs at his lies. During their conversation she sees Lehman arrive at the hotel and walks out. Lehman tells \"Jonathan\" that Libby believes he is her dead ex-husband and informs the local police that she is in the area.\n\nThe next day Libby arranges to meet Nick at Lafayette Cemetery No. 3 (filmed at Lafayette Cemetery No. 1) to take Matty.

Article:\n\n\"\"\"== Infobox ==\nType: Blood sausage\nCourse: Street food\nPlace of origin: Korea\nAssociated cuisine: Korean cuisine\nMedia: Sundae\n\n== History ==\nThe sundae sausage dates back to the Goryeo period (918–1392), when wild boars, prominent across the Korean Peninsula, were used in the dish. Recipes for sundae are found in nineteenth century cookbooks including Gyuhap chongseo and Siuijeonseo.\n\nTraditional sundae, cow or pig intestines stuffed with seonji (blood), minced meats, rice, and vegetables, was an indulgent food consumed during special occasions, festivities and large family gatherings. After the Korean War, when meat was scarce during the period of post-war poverty, dangmyeon replaced meat fillings in South Korea. Sundae became an inexpensive street snack sold in bunsikjip (snack bars), pojangmacha (street stalls), and traditional markets.\n\n== Varieties ==\nTraditional South Korean varieties, as well as all North Korean, Russian Korean (Koryo-saram and Sakhalin Korean), and Chinese Korean sundae fillings include seonji (blood), minced meat, rice, and vegetables. Modern South Korean bunsik (snack food) varieties often use dangmyeon (glass noodles) instead of meat, rice, and vegetables. Other fillings include kkaennip (perilla leaves), scallions, doenjang (soybean paste), kimchi, and soybean sprouts.\n\nRegional varieties include abai-sundae (아바이순대) from the Hamgyong and Pyongan Provinces, Kaesong-sundae (개성순대) from Kaesong, Baegam-sundae (백암순대) from Yongin, Jeju-sundae (제주순대) from Jeju Island, Byeongcheon-sundae (병천순대) from Chungcheong Province, and amppong-sundae (암뽕순대) from Jeolla Province.\n\nSome varieties use seafood as casing. Ojingeo-sundae (오징어순대), made with fresh squid, is a local specialty of Gangwon, while mareun-ojingeo-sundae (마른오징어순대) made with dried squid is eaten in Gangwon as well as Gyeonggi. Myeongtae-sundae (명태순대), made with Alaska pollock is a local specialty of Gangwon and Hamgyong. Eogyo-sundae (어교순대) is made with the swim bladder of brown croakers.\n\n== Accompaniments ==\nIn South Korea, sundae is often steamed and served with steamed offals such as gan (liver) and heopa (lung). Sliced pieces of sundae and sides are dipped in salt-black pepper mixture (Seoul), in vinegar-gochujang mixture (Honam), seasoned soybean paste in Yeongnam, and soy sauce in Jeju. Sundae is sold a lot at guk-bap restaurants or bunsikjip(snack bars). As sundae is often sold in bunsikjip, along with tteok-bokki (stir-fried rice cakes) and twigim (fritters), it is also dipped in tteok-bokki sauce. Many bunsikjip offer tteok-twi-sun, a set menu with tteok-bokki, twigim and sundae.\"\"\""}

One of his grandfathers (apparently Wailer C. Caldwell) was a Tennessee Supreme Court justice.\n\nHe grew up in Lakeland, Florida. After his father died, Caldwell, at the age of ten, went to work on the Lakeland Evening Ledger as a solicitor of circulation. While still a child and in his early teens, according to a 1979 interview, he sold \"hair straighteners, a line of cosmetics to blacks, delivered newspapers and sold newspapers as a street salesman.\" In addition, he worked nights as a masseur.\n\nAt about age 14 he formed a small \"citrus fruit tree trimming, spraying, fertilizing service\" that employed \"about eighteen kids.\" He saved enough money to pay his first year through college, and returned to Tennessee to do so in 1930, but five banks \"busted right out from under me\" before he could go to school. His mother managed to arrange \"a grant or scholarship or something as a potential ministerial student\" so he could start as a freshman at Southwestern at Memphis. His freshman English teacher was Robert Penn Warren. While studying there, he worked in circulation on the Memphis Press-Scimitar and Memphis Commercial Appeal.\n\nIn 1931, after a year at Southwestern, he went to Trenton, Tennessee, where he worked on the Trenton Herald Democrat. He then attended Cumberland University Law School in Lebanon, Tennessee, where two of his great grandfathers \"had been very successful lawyers and politicians and law teachers.\" One of them was Nathan Green Sr., who was a founder of the law school. Green's son, Caldwell's maternal grandfather, was Nathan Green Jr., a law professor there.\n\n== Career ==\nHe joined the Nashville Tennessean in 1934; his first assignment at the Tennessean \"covering the new alphabet agencies\" formed by FDR. At the paper, he worked in turn as a general assignment, political, labor relations, and regional economics reporter. \"His work included investigative reporting, environmental reporting, political correspondence, feature writing and editorial writing.\" In his later years, Caldwell \"was a mentor to many young members of the staff.\" An expert on the Tennessee Valley Authority, he covered the agency for 20 years.\n\nIn 1940, he spent a year at Harvard University, where he studied labor relations, utility organization, and civic management on a Nieman Fellowship.\n\nHe served in the U.S. Navy during World War II.

He studied Tennessee Valley Authority-style development in Israel and Arab nations, interviewed officials in several Middle Eastern cities, and noted the Iraqi consulate's refusal to give him a visa to visit Baghdad in the company of a United Nations mission on refugees. According to the Tennessee Newspaper Hall of Fame, the feature story that resulted \"resonates more than 50 years later and provided a portrait of conflicts to come.\"\n\nCaldwell himself described a series of eight articles about \"the migration of millions of black and poor white people out of the South as a consequence of the anticipated mechanization of Southern agriculture\" as his \"most significant\" project.

One of his grandfathers (apparently Wailer C. Caldwell) was a Tennessee Supreme Court justice.\n\nHe grew up in Lakeland, Florida. After his father died, Caldwell, at the age of ten, went to work on the Lakeland Evening Ledger as a solicitor of circulation. While still a child and in his early teens, according to a 1979 interview, he sold \"hair straighteners, a line of cosmetics to blacks, delivered newspapers and sold newspapers as a street salesman.\" In addition, he worked nights as a masseur.\n\nAt about age 14 he formed a small \"citrus fruit tree trimming, spraying, fertilizing service\" that employed \"about eighteen kids.\" He saved enough money to pay his first year through college, and returned to Tennessee to do so in 1930, but five banks \"busted right out from under me\" before he could go to school. His mother managed to arrange \"a grant or scholarship or something as a potential ministerial student\" so he could start as a freshman at Southwestern at Memphis. His freshman English teacher was Robert Penn Warren. While studying there, he worked in circulation on the Memphis Press-Scimitar and Memphis Commercial Appeal.\n\nIn 1931, after a year at Southwestern, he went to Trenton, Tennessee, where he worked on the Trenton Herald Democrat. He then attended Cumberland University Law School in Lebanon, Tennessee, where two of his great grandfathers \"had been very successful lawyers and politicians and law teachers.\" One of them was Nathan Green Sr., who was a founder of the law school. Green's son, Caldwell's maternal grandfather, was Nathan Green Jr., a law professor there.\n\n== Career ==\nHe joined the Nashville Tennessean in 1934; his first assignment at the Tennessean \"covering the new alphabet agencies\" formed by FDR. At the paper, he worked in turn as a general assignment, political, labor relations, and regional economics reporter. \"His work included investigative reporting, environmental reporting, political correspondence, feature writing and editorial writing.\" In his later years, Caldwell \"was a mentor to many young members of the staff.\" An expert on the Tennessee Valley Authority, he covered the agency for 20 years.\n\nIn 1940, he spent a year at Harvard University, where he studied labor relations, utility organization, and civic management on a Nieman Fellowship.\n\nHe served in the U.S. Navy during World War II. After the war he \"stayed in as an enlisted [man] for another six months\" so he could go to Siberia. He also went to Shanghai.\n\nDuring his years at The Tennessean, he \"exposed labor-management corruption, strip mining abuses, nursing home maltreatment of the elderly, civil rights violations and government corruption at the federal, state and local levels.\" Caldwell \"was known across the region of the Tennessee Valley as a journalist whose stories often reflected a positive tone. He was a crusading reporter, for example, on behalf of public power and community development.\" A former Tennessee Valley Authority chairman said, \"Nat Caldwell is responsible for more TVA and Corps of Engineers dams and lakes than any member of Congress.\"\n\nFor a 1968 series on nursing home care, Caldwell had himself admitted into one such home in Nashville. \"Nashvillians who plan to send an elderly relative to one of this city's 26 nursing homes,\" he wrote at the beginning of the first article, \"should be aware that they may be committing their loved one to a crowded, unsanitary, ignored existence.\" One nursing home owner told colleagues of Caldwell's, posing as his niece and nephew \"You got to conquer an old man like that.\" Caldwell wrote, \"I have been called a hard-boiled reporter. Often. In those three weeks, I cried. And not at anything that happened to me.\" The six-week investigation by him and other reporters involved all 26 private nursing homes in Nashville.\n\nIn 1976, after Caldwell wrote an article challenging Mississippi businessman James F. Hooper III's qualifications to serve on the TVA board, Hooper sued Caldwell, along with the Tennessean, East Tennessee Research Corp., and two of that firm's employees, for over $2.4 million in a libel suit.\n\nOn one occasion, The Tennessean \"had to provide police protection when a series of articles resulted in his being physically assaulted.\" Another time, \"the newspaper was sued for $1 million by a nominee for the TVA Board after a U.S. Senate Committee recited Caldwell's news stories as grounds for refusing to confirm the nomination.\"\n\nIn 1949, he spent several months in the Middle East. He studied Tennessee Valley Authority-style development in Israel and Arab nations, interviewed officials in several Middle Eastern cities, and noted the Iraqi consulate's refusal to give him a visa to visit Baghdad in the company of a United Nations mission on refugees. According to the Tennessee Newspaper Hall of Fame, the feature story that resulted \"resonates more than 50 years later and provided a portrait of conflicts to come.\"\n\nCaldwell himself described a series of eight articles about \"the migration of millions of black and poor white people out of the South as a consequence of the anticipated mechanization of Southern agriculture\" as his \"most significant\" project. For this story, Charles S. Johnson, president of Fisk University, chartered a small plane for six weeks in which Caldwell traveled around the country interviewing \"black families who left Southern farms and migrated to military defense plants during World War II.\" His series was reprinted in twenty-eight newspapers, including the London Times, the New York Herald Tribune, and the Chicago Sun-Times, with magazines like Newsweek and The Atlantic Monthly summing up his conclusions.\n\n== Honors and awards ==\nIn 1946 he won a Rosenwald Fellowship for a study of the migration of African Americans out of the South.\n\nIn 1962, Caldwell and a colleague at the Tennessean, Gene S. Graham, shared the Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting for \"their exclusive disclosure and six years of detailed reporting, under great difficulties, of the undercover cooperation between management interests in the coal industry and the United Mine Workers.\" They had worked together for six years on the story, and \"exposed a sweetheart deal between John L. Lewis, president of the United Mine Workers, and Cyrus Eaton, the billionaire financier who had major interests in the coal fields.\" Their articles, published under both journalists' bylines, \"exposed how the deal robbed mine workers, many suffering from black lung disease, of their hospitalization,\" and led to a federal investigation and to lawsuits in which the union was found guilty of violating anti-trust laws. From the beginning, Lewis called Caldwell and Graham liars, and according to Caldwell, the New York Times investigated him to determine whether this was the case.\n\nHe was inducted into the Tennessee Newspaper Hall of Fame in 2003.\n\n== Personal life and views ==\nHe married Camilla Frances Johnson (perhaps spelled Jonson) in 1936. They had one son, John Sam, who went to Harvard.\n\n\"I wound up with a bad taste for the morals of capitalism that remained in my life ever since,\" he said in 1979, identifying himself as a socialist. He explained that the \"privations\" he endured in his youth taught him that \"you had to save money\" and \"invest it.\" As a result, he said, \"when I get ready to cash out my chips I will leave a much larger estate than most people leave who go to work for the New York Times.\"\n\n== Death ==\nCaldwell died when his car went off a bridge into a lake near his home in Gallatin, Tennessee, on February 11, 1985.

He attended the Capuchin-run Serafijns College in Bruges and on 28 September 1901 joined the Capuchin Order in Enghien, taking the religious name Hildebrand. He was ordained to the priesthood in Enghien on 13 October 1907 and was sent to study at the Catholic University of Leuven, where he graduated Bachelor of Theology in 1909. He taught Church History and Patristics at the Capuchin seminary in Izegem for two years before being sent to Rome, where he briefly worked at the Collegio Internazionale di San Lorenzo da Brindisi before returning to Belgium.\n\nIn 1913 he appointed archivist to the order's Belgian province, and became founding editor of the journal Neerlandia Franciscana. Publication was suspended after the first issue due to the First World War, during which Hildebrand was auxiliary assistant pastor (1914–1915) and then acting pastor (1916–1918) in Rollegem-Kapelle, in 1917–1918 also acting as chaplain to Italian prisoners of war that the Germans put to work on the front in Belgium. He resumed his work as lecturer and editor after the war, and the second issue of Neerlandia Franciscana was published in 1919. In 1921 the title was changed to Franciscana but in 1924 the order closed down the journal due the costs of publication.\n\nIn 1927 Hildebrand was invited to join the editorial board of Ons Geestelijk Erf. In 1929 the archive was moved to the Capuchin convent in Antwerp, and Hildebrand as archivist moved with it. He was released from other duties, so that he could dedicate his time to archival and historical work. After the Second World War he began publishing his ten-volume history of the Capuchin order in the Low Countries.\n\nHildebrand retired in 1958, after 45 years as archivist, and moved back to Izegem.

Kreyer competed in the Wisconsin Challenge Series and CRA Super Series in 2004.\n\nKreyer competed in the Wisconsin Challenge Series for the entire 2005 season, and finished tenth in the final points standings.\n\nHe competed in half of the American Speed Association late model races in 2006, but he was able to score enough points to finish in the Top 20 in points. Kreyer purchased Wisconsin Dells Speedway with two other co-owners, closing on the purchase of the track in February 2007, and renamed the track Dells Raceway Park. The new owners have brought the American Speed Association sanction to the track.\n\n== NASCAR career ==\nKreyer made his first NASCAR start in the Craftsman Truck Series at the Kroger 250 at Martinsville Speedway on March 31, 2007. He started 27th and finished 28th seven laps behind the leader. He also started 22nd at Mansfield Motorsports Speedway, and finished 34th with motor problems.\n\nHe started two Busch series races in 2007. He started 32nd and crashed out finishing 34th in his home race at the Milwaukee Mile. He started 38th at Gateway International Raceway, and finished 38th with brake problems.\n\nEarly in 2007 Kreyer announced that he would be attempting to qualify the Mac Hill Motorsports car for four NASCAR Busch Series races in 2007. He made all four races and had a best finish of 28th at O'Reilly Raceway Park.\n\n== NASCAR ==\n(key) (Bold – Pole position awarded by qualifying time.

Since 1969 the Austrian Grand Prix has taken place in neighbouring Spielberg, with the two venues being within approximately 4 km (2.5 mi) of each other. It was first held at the Zeltweg Air Base for six years, before a permanent track, originally called the Österreichring and later known as the A-1 ring and Red Bull Ring, was built.\n\n== Zeltweg Airfield circuit ==\nA non-championship event was held in 1963 at a race track on the Zeltweg Airfield and it was won by Australian Jack Brabham. The first championship event took place in the following year, and Italian Lorenzo Bandini won his only Formula One championship race in a Ferrari. The race was a success, but the track was deemed too dangerous; it was narrow and very bumpy, and spectators complained of poor viewing areas. The FIA removed the race from the F1 calendar until a suitable track was built.\n\nThe event was run in 1965 as a non-championship sports car race, the Zeltweg 200 Miles, before being adopted by the World Sportscar Championship from 1966 to 1969 as the 1000 km Zeltweg.\n\n== Österreichring ==\nFrom 1970 until 1987, the event was held at the Österreichring (translated literally as \"Austria circuit\", also located near Zeltweg). It was built in the scenic Styrian mountains and it was a fast, flowing track where every corner was high speed and long. The Austrian Grand Prix was designated the European Grand Prix once, 1975, when this title was an honorary designation given each year to one Grand Prix race in Europe. The very fast track was popular with drivers, and the events were moderately successful. The first race on this track was dominated by Ferrari, with their more powerful Flat-12 engines enabled them to be 10 mph faster – which is a lot in racing terms. The 1971 race saw Swiss driver Jo Siffert dominate in his BRM and Briton Jackie Stewart took his second Drivers' Championship. The 1975 event was marred by the fatal accident of American Mark Donohue, and the race itself was rain-soaked and was won by Vittorio Brambilla, winning the only F1 race of his career, and, true to form, he crashed into the guardrail and broke the nose of his car shortly after crossing the finish line when the race was stopped early because the rain got worse (although the race started after 1 hour and 15 minutes of delay, due the heavy rain, with the drivers doing extra practice during this time). In 1976, home favourite Niki Lauda's appalling crash at the Nürburgring caused him to miss the race, which was won by Briton John Watson in the short-lived Penske F1 team, winning his first Formula One race (and Penske's only win in the category).\n\n1976 had seen the Voest-Hugel corner changed slightly into one corner instead of two corners; but 1977 saw a slow three-corner chicane installed at Voest-Hugel, which was where Donohue had crashed two years before. What was the fastest corner on the track was now the slowest corner there and would become known as the Hella-Licht Chicane. This race was won by Australian Alan Jones in a Shadow; and like with Brambilla and Watson, it was his first Grand Prix victory. 1978 saw the dominant Lotus 79s on the front row, and American Mario Andretti crashed at the Glatz Kurve on the first lap, and his teammate, Swede Ronnie Peterson took victory. 1979 started to show the superiority of turbo-charged engines on this fast and high-altitude circuit. Although Jones won again in a Williams, Jean-Pierre Jabouille and Rene Arnoux in their Renaults were able to dominate this event and also the following year's race, which Jabouille won. 1981 saw three turbo-charged cars dominate the front row; and into the race, the immense power and dreadful handling of Didier Pironi's Ferrari helped him to hold up four better handling cars and get into a five-way battle for third place, which went on for a while but the four cars eventually passed him, one of which was Jacques Laffite who went on to win the race. 1982 saw a spectacular show in which five turbocharged cars dominated the grid; all but one of these cars retired with mechanical problems, including Italian Riccardo Patrese who had a spectacular accident at the Texaco Bends, and Frenchman Alain Prost whose engine expired with a few laps to go while in the lead. After Prost's retirement, the race turned into a dead-heat sprint between Italian Elio de Angelis in a Lotus and Finn Keke Rosberg in a Williams. In the beginning, Rosberg had been steadily chipping away at de Angelis; but after Prost retired, Rosberg began to make up 1.5 seconds a lap on de Angelis; and on the last lap the two so-far winless drivers battled for victory, and de Angelis was able to hold off Rosberg and win by less than half a car's length; 0.05 seconds. 1984 saw Lauda finally take victory at home Grand Prix in his McLaren, and Prost won the next two races. The 1985 race saw a fearsome crash at the Panorama Curve when Andrea de Cesaris spectacularly rolled his Ligier, which led to him being fired from the team. 1986 saw Austrian driver Gerhard Berger lead the early laps in his 1,400 bhp (1,044 kW; 1,419 PS) Benetton-BMW, but electrical problems saw his race ruined allowing Alain Prost to take the win by over a lap from the Ferraris of Michele Alboreto and Stefan Johansson.\n\nThe 1987 race was restarted twice due to accidents on the narrow pit-straight grid; and this track was also deemed too dangerous by FIA standards, because of the number of high-speed corners, lack of protection from trees and embankments and accidents at the start of many races on the narrow and confined pit straight. Increasing speeds were also a growing problem at the Österreichring: that year, polesitter Nelson Piquet averaged 159.457 mph (255.756 km/h) in his 1,100 hp Honda-powered Williams. Piquet finished second to his teammate, Briton Nigel Mansell. Attempts to bring the race back were unsuccessful, and the event disappeared for a decade.\n\n== A1-Ring ==\nIn 1995 and 1996, the Österreichring was refurbished and brought up to date, which allowed the race to run again in 1997. Since the track, which was renamed A1-Ring after a sponsor, is located on the municipal territory of Spielberg, Spielberg was now given as the site of the Grand Prix. The whole layout was redesigned by Hermann Tilke, and the track lost all of its long, sweeping corners, aside from the Texaco Bends (which were made shorter and slower) and the Hella-Licht chicane, Flatschach, Dr. Tiroch curve and the first half of the backstretch run up to where the Bosch-Kurve was taken out and replaced with a bypass that went directly to the second half of the fast, uphill backstretch. The 2002 event received negative publicity after Ferrari instructed Rubens Barrichello to cede his victory to Michael Schumacher. It was a mainstay on the calendar until hosting its final race in 2003.\n\n== Red Bull Ring ==\nIn July 2013, it was reported that the circuit's new owners Red Bull GmbH had reached an agreement with Bernie Ecclestone to revive the Austrian Grand Prix after a ten-year absence from the calendar.

The 1975 event was marred by the fatal accident of American Mark Donohue, and the race itself was rain-soaked and was won by Vittorio Brambilla, winning the only F1 race of his career, and, true to form, he crashed into the guardrail and broke the nose of his car shortly after crossing the finish line when the race was stopped early because the rain got worse (although the race started after 1 hour and 15 minutes of delay, due the heavy rain, with the drivers doing extra practice during this time). In 1976, home favourite Niki Lauda's appalling crash at the Nürburgring caused him to miss the race, which was won by Briton John Watson in the short-lived Penske F1 team, winning his first Formula One race (and Penske's only win in the category).\n\n1976 had seen the Voest-Hugel corner changed slightly into one corner instead of two corners; but 1977 saw a slow three-corner chicane installed at Voest-Hugel, which was where Donohue had crashed two years before. What was the fastest corner on the track was now the slowest corner there and would become known as the Hella-Licht Chicane. This race was won by Australian Alan Jones in a Shadow; and like with Brambilla and Watson, it was his first Grand Prix victory. 1978 saw the dominant Lotus 79s on the front row, and American Mario Andretti crashed at the Glatz Kurve on the first lap, and his teammate, Swede Ronnie Peterson took victory. 1979 started to show the superiority of turbo-charged engines on this fast and high-altitude circuit. Although Jones won again in a Williams, Jean-Pierre Jabouille and Rene Arnoux in their Renaults were able to dominate this event and also the following year's race, which Jabouille won. 1981 saw three turbo-charged cars dominate the front row; and into the race, the immense power and dreadful handling of Didier Pironi's Ferrari helped him to hold up four better handling cars and get into a five-way battle for third place, which went on for a while but the four cars eventually passed him, one of which was Jacques Laffite who went on to win the race. 1982 saw a spectacular show in which five turbocharged cars dominated the grid; all but one of these cars retired with mechanical problems, including Italian Riccardo Patrese who had a spectacular accident at the Texaco Bends, and Frenchman Alain Prost whose engine expired with a few laps to go while in the lead. After Prost's retirement, the race turned into a dead-heat sprint between Italian Elio de Angelis in a Lotus and Finn Keke Rosberg in a Williams. In the beginning, Rosberg had been steadily chipping away at de Angelis; but after Prost retired, Rosberg began to make up 1.5 seconds a lap on de Angelis; and on the last lap the two so-far winless drivers battled for victory, and de Angelis was able to hold off Rosberg and win by less than half a car's length; 0.05 seconds. 1984 saw Lauda finally take victory at home Grand Prix in his McLaren, and Prost won the next two races. The 1985 race saw a fearsome crash at the Panorama Curve when Andrea de Cesaris spectacularly rolled his Ligier, which led to him being fired from the team. 1986 saw Austrian driver Gerhard Berger lead the early laps in his 1,400 bhp (1,044 kW; 1,419 PS) Benetton-BMW, but electrical problems saw his race ruined allowing Alain Prost to take the win by over a lap from the Ferraris of Michele Alboreto and Stefan Johansson.\n\nThe 1987 race was restarted twice due to accidents on the narrow pit-straight grid; and this track was also deemed too dangerous by FIA standards, because of the number of high-speed corners, lack of protection from trees and embankments and accidents at the start of many races on the narrow and confined pit straight. Increasing speeds were also a growing problem at the Österreichring: that year, polesitter Nelson Piquet averaged 159.457 mph (255.756 km/h) in his 1,100 hp Honda-powered Williams. Piquet finished second to his teammate, Briton Nigel Mansell. Attempts to bring the race back were unsuccessful, and the event disappeared for a decade.\n\n== A1-Ring ==\nIn 1995 and 1996, the Österreichring was refurbished and brought up to date, which allowed the race to run again in 1997. Since the track, which was renamed A1-Ring after a sponsor, is located on the municipal territory of Spielberg, Spielberg was now given as the site of the Grand Prix. The whole layout was redesigned by Hermann Tilke, and the track lost all of its long, sweeping corners, aside from the Texaco Bends (which were made shorter and slower) and the Hella-Licht chicane, Flatschach, Dr. Tiroch curve and the first half of the backstretch run up to where the Bosch-Kurve was taken out and replaced with a bypass that went directly to the second half of the fast, uphill backstretch. The 2002 event received negative publicity after Ferrari instructed Rubens Barrichello to cede his victory to Michael Schumacher. It was a mainstay on the calendar until hosting its final race in 2003.\n\n== Red Bull Ring ==\nIn July 2013, it was reported that the circuit's new owners Red Bull GmbH had reached an agreement with Bernie Ecclestone to revive the Austrian Grand Prix after a ten-year absence from the calendar. The race was given a provisional date of July 2014. On 6 December, the officially released calendar included the Austrian Grand Prix on it.\n\n== Repeat winners (drivers) ==\nDrivers in bold are competing in the Formula One championship in the current season.

Martin as Acting Governor\nSucceeded by: Joseph Taylor Robinson\n=== Personal details ===\nBorn: July 1, 1856 Union Parish, Louisiana, U.S.\nDied: December 15, 1937 (aged 81) Little Rock, Arkansas, U.S.\nResting place: Roselawn Memorial Park in Little Rock\nPolitical party: Democratic\nSpouse: Louvenia Wallace Donaghey (married 1887-1937, his death)\nAlma mater: University of Arkansas\nProfession: Developer\n\n== Early life and education ==\nDonaghey was born as the oldest of five children to Christopher Columbus and Elizabeth (née Ingram) Donaghey, in the Oakland Community in Union Parish in north Louisiana. His father's family was from Ireland and his mother's from Scotland. His father Christopher was a farmer who moved from Alabama to northern Louisiana, purchasing land there, and later moved to Arkansas where he served in the Confederate Army.\n\nIn 1875, without letting his family know, Donaghey moved to Texas where he worked as a cowboy on the Chisholm Trail and farmer, but later moved again to Arkansas in 1876 due to cowboy lifestyle and health issues. From 1882 to 1883, he attended the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville. He was a school teacher and carpenter, and studied both architecture and structural engineering. In 1883, Donaghey established his residence at Conway, Arkansas, and adopted that city as his hometown. There, he later met his wife Louvenia Wallace; they had no children. One of the major streets there bears his name. He served one term as town marshal and was an unsuccessful prohibition candidate for mayor in 1885.\n\nHaving himself lacked a formal education, Donaghey worked diligently to bring institutions of higher learning to Conway. He served on the boards of Philander Smith College in Little Rock, Hendrix College (to which he donated $75,000 in 1910), the University of Central Arkansas, State Normal School (where he was the principal speaker for its 1908 dedication) and Little Rock Junior College (both now part of University of Central Arkansas) in Conway, where his service extended from 1906 until his death. Additionally, he gave generously to both institutions.\n\n== Business ==\nDonaghey entered business as a contractor and constructed courthouses in Texas and Arkansas, including the first bank building in Conway in 1890. Shortly afterward, he detoured into the mercantile business—for his contracting business was not profitable in its early years—and suffered significant losses after building the second Faulkner County courthouse. When he returned, he reconstructed the Arkansas Insane Asylum after a tornado in 1894. He built ice plants and roads in Arkansas, and water tanks and railroad stations for the Choctaw, Oklahoma and Gulf Railroad, and often invested in farm and timber land.\n\nIn 1899, Donaghey was appointed to the commission tasked with constructing the new state capitol. The project was not complete until a dozen years later; during much of that time Jefferson \"Jeff\" Davis was state governor and firmly opposed all the new plans. This obstruction impelled Donaghey to enter politics; eventually in 1907 he sought the nomination for governor, in the teeth of opposition from Davis (who had been elected U.S. senator for Arkansas) and Davis's ally William F. Kirby.\n\n== As governor ==\nIn 1908, Donaghey won a three-way primary election that broke the hold of Jeff Davis on the Arkansas Democratic Party. He then attained an easy victory in the gubernatorial general election with 106,512 votes, over Republican John I. Worthington (42,979) and Socialist J. Sam Jones (6,537). Worthington had also run in 1906 against Davis. Donaghey had to wait ten months to take office. In the meantime he traveled the country, and as professor Calvin Ledbetter, Jr. of the University of Arkansas at Little Rock points out in his book The Carpenter from Conway, Donaghey educated himself for the political office which awaited him. In June 1909, he appointed the fourth and final state capitol commission and hired Cass Gilbert for the architecture project.\n\nDonaghey was reelected in 1910, defeating another Republican, Andrew L. Roland, by 101,612 votes to 38,870. Another 9,196 ballots were cast for the Socialist candidate, Dan Hogan. That same year he negotiated with the Southern Regional Education Board to bring its campaign to Arkansas, which had successful results in the state, and he also supported four agricultural high schools that later formed into Arkansas Tech University, Arkansas State University, Southern Arkansas University and the University of Arkansas at Monticello. His actions in 1910 also included helping to create the Booneville Tuberculosis Sanatorium, thus improving public health; he later also negotiated with the Rockefeller Sanitary Commission to eradicate hookworm. During his term, Arkansas was the first state in the country to require smallpox vaccinations for all schoolchildren and school personnel, and the Crossett malaria control experiment campaigned against the mosquitos. Donaghey's achievements included establishment of a new state board of education, support for high schools, and the passage of a law making consolidation easier.\n\nAlthough several of the prisoners he pardoned from the convict lease program were black, Donaghey still supported segregation. In 1910 at the state Baptist Colored Convention in Little Rock, he said \"It is not for any political purpose that I come to talk to you. It is not for the purpose of getting your votes, this you know as well as I do, because your people don't vote much. This, perhaps, is best for you. The greatest man in your race [Booker T. Washington] has said that you should keep out of politics and in this I agree with him. I think it is best that you stay out of politics and look after the condition of your people, and in this you have as much as you can do\". In autumn 1911, he appeared with Booker T. Washington at the National Negro Business League and said to an audience of one thousand black men to \"not waste their time running around begging for social equality\". The Chicago Defender quoted him as saying \"You must ride in the last two seats in our street cars; you must not sit in a Pullman car; you must not ride on the same deck, nor eat in the same restaurant, nor drink in the same saloon as me...You are a race of degenerates, your women are lewd and we cannot afford to have our white women and children associate with you\".\n\nDonaghey's progressive stance procured passage of the Initiative and Referendum Act by which Arkansans can take governmental matters into their own hands and bypass the state legislature. He recruited William Jennings Bryan to help campaign for the amendment's adoption in 1910. Arkansas is the only state in the American South to grant its citizens such power. The initiative, which began in South Dakota, is otherwise particularly known in California and Colorado.\n\nThe Donaghey administration focused on roads, public health, and railroads. Donaghey was vehemently opposed to the use of prisoners for contract-leased labor, especially for building railroads. He particularly learned about convict lease while at a Southern governors' conference in West Virginia in autumn 1912. Unable to get the legislature to abolish the practice, he prior to leaving office pardoned 360 prisoners, 44 in country farms and 316 out of 850 in penitentiaries and 37 percent of the incarcerated population. This left the lease system with insufficient available prisoners for utilization in construction. In 1913, a year after Donaghey left office, the legislature finally ended the practice and a new prison board was formed.\n\nIn 1912, he was eager for a third term, hoping to take care of statewide prohibition and the much-needed tax reform, but the legislature rejected his reforms and the electorate rejected his prohibition plans. During his campaign for the third term the state capitol project ran out of money, and Donaghey's appropriation plans were not successful. What also helped bring on his defeat was that former governor Jeff Davis and his allies also campaigned for governor, along with emerging powerbroker Joseph Taylor Robinson.\n\nDonaghey was the first Arkansas governor who could indisputably be labeled 'progressive' but was also within the southern progressive tradition, as well as the first businessman to become governor of Arkansas.\n\n== After being governor ==\nAfter his bid for a third term as governor was defeated by Joseph Taylor Robinson in 1912, Donaghey persisted in his quest to complete the Capitol. A critical year was 1913. Senator Jeff Davis died two days into the year. Robinson, by this time state governor, was named by the legislature as Davis's successor. J. M. Futtrell, president of the Arkansas Senate, became acting governor. The result was that Futtrell and the Capitol Building Commission asked Donaghey to become a commission member and take charge of completing construction, which he did. The Capitol, valued at more than $300 million today, was completed in 1917 for $2.2 million, ending an 18-year effort. As a hallmark to completion, Donaghey personally built the governor's conference table, which sets today as the centerpiece of the governor's conference room in the north wing of the Capitol.\n\nAs a former governor, Donaghey served on a number of boards and commissions responsible for a variety of tasks such as constructions, education, and charities. He penned the book Build a State Capitol, which details the construction of the Arkansas capitol building.\n\nDonaghey died from a heart attack in Little Rock in 1937, and is interred there at the Roselawn Memorial Park Cemetery. His estate is managed by George W. Donaghey Foundation in Little Rock.\n\nFormer Arkansas Governor (1949-1953) Sid McMath said in his memoir Promises Kept: a Memoir that Donaghey was \"without a doubt, one of the great governors of Arkansas and served as an inspiration to my administration and to others, particularly in the continuing struggle for human rights, and I decided to continue what he had begun\". One book called him \"arguably one of the best and most influential governors and philanthropists in Arkansas history\".\n\nIn 1999, the Log Cabin Democrat named him one of the ten most influential people in Faulkner County's history.\n\n== Donaghey's Monument ==\nIn 1931, Donaghey, who felt a kinship to both Arkansas and Louisiana, established a monument at the Union Parish/Union County state line near his birthplace. The Art Deco-style monument contains intricate carvings; it includes references to transportation in 1831 and 1931, and mentions Governor Huey P. Long, Jr., whose educational program Donaghey admired. The land was not registered with state parks offices in either state, timber companies cut trees around it, and the marker was forgotten.\n\nIn 1975, an employee of the Louisiana Department of Transportation came across the abandoned monument and informed then-State Representative Louise B. Johnson of Bernice of his discovery.\n\nThe Monument was dedicated in 1933; Donaghey died four years later.

His father Christopher was a farmer who moved from Alabama to northern Louisiana, purchasing land there, and later moved to Arkansas where he served in the Confederate Army.\n\nIn 1875, without letting his family know, Donaghey moved to Texas where he worked as a cowboy on the Chisholm Trail and farmer, but later moved again to Arkansas in 1876 due to cowboy lifestyle and health issues. From 1882 to 1883, he attended the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville. He was a school teacher and carpenter, and studied both architecture and structural engineering. In 1883, Donaghey established his residence at Conway, Arkansas, and adopted that city as his hometown. There, he later met his wife Louvenia Wallace; they had no children. One of the major streets there bears his name. He served one term as town marshal and was an unsuccessful prohibition candidate for mayor in 1885.\n\nHaving himself lacked a formal education, Donaghey worked diligently to bring institutions of higher learning to Conway. He served on the boards of Philander Smith College in Little Rock, Hendrix College (to which he donated $75,000 in 1910), the University of Central Arkansas, State Normal School (where he was the principal speaker for its 1908 dedication) and Little Rock Junior College (both now part of University of Central Arkansas) in Conway, where his service extended from 1906 until his death. Additionally, he gave generously to both institutions.\n\n== Business ==\nDonaghey entered business as a contractor and constructed courthouses in Texas and Arkansas, including the first bank building in Conway in 1890. Shortly afterward, he detoured into the mercantile business—for his contracting business was not profitable in its early years—and suffered significant losses after building the second Faulkner County courthouse. When he returned, he reconstructed the Arkansas Insane Asylum after a tornado in 1894. He built ice plants and roads in Arkansas, and water tanks and railroad stations for the Choctaw, Oklahoma and Gulf Railroad, and often invested in farm and timber land.\n\nIn 1899, Donaghey was appointed to the commission tasked with constructing the new state capitol. The project was not complete until a dozen years later; during much of that time Jefferson \"Jeff\" Davis was state governor and firmly opposed all the new plans. This obstruction impelled Donaghey to enter politics; eventually in 1907 he sought the nomination for governor, in the teeth of opposition from Davis (who had been elected U.S. senator for Arkansas) and Davis's ally William F. Kirby.\n\n== As governor ==\nIn 1908, Donaghey won a three-way primary election that broke the hold of Jeff Davis on the Arkansas Democratic Party. He then attained an easy victory in the gubernatorial general election with 106,512 votes, over Republican John I. Worthington (42,979) and Socialist J. Sam Jones (6,537). Worthington had also run in 1906 against Davis. Donaghey had to wait ten months to take office. In the meantime he traveled the country, and as professor Calvin Ledbetter, Jr. of the University of Arkansas at Little Rock points out in his book The Carpenter from Conway, Donaghey educated himself for the political office which awaited him. In June 1909, he appointed the fourth and final state capitol commission and hired Cass Gilbert for the architecture project.\n\nDonaghey was reelected in 1910, defeating another Republican, Andrew L. Roland, by 101,612 votes to 38,870. Another 9,196 ballots were cast for the Socialist candidate, Dan Hogan. That same year he negotiated with the Southern Regional Education Board to bring its campaign to Arkansas, which had successful results in the state, and he also supported four agricultural high schools that later formed into Arkansas Tech University, Arkansas State University, Southern Arkansas University and the University of Arkansas at Monticello. His actions in 1910 also included helping to create the Booneville Tuberculosis Sanatorium, thus improving public health; he later also negotiated with the Rockefeller Sanitary Commission to eradicate hookworm. During his term, Arkansas was the first state in the country to require smallpox vaccinations for all schoolchildren and school personnel, and the Crossett malaria control experiment campaigned against the mosquitos. Donaghey's achievements included establishment of a new state board of education, support for high schools, and the passage of a law making consolidation easier.\n\nAlthough several of the prisoners he pardoned from the convict lease program were black, Donaghey still supported segregation. In 1910 at the state Baptist Colored Convention in Little Rock, he said \"It is not for any political purpose that I come to talk to you. It is not for the purpose of getting your votes, this you know as well as I do, because your people don't vote much. This, perhaps, is best for you. The greatest man in your race [Booker T. Washington] has said that you should keep out of politics and in this I agree with him. I think it is best that you stay out of politics and look after the condition of your people, and in this you have as much as you can do\". In autumn 1911, he appeared with Booker T. Washington at the National Negro Business League and said to an audience of one thousand black men to \"not waste their time running around begging for social equality\". The Chicago Defender quoted him as saying \"You must ride in the last two seats in our street cars; you must not sit in a Pullman car; you must not ride on the same deck, nor eat in the same restaurant, nor drink in the same saloon as me...You are a race of degenerates, your women are lewd and we cannot afford to have our white women and children associate with you\".\n\nDonaghey's progressive stance procured passage of the Initiative and Referendum Act by which Arkansans can take governmental matters into their own hands and bypass the state legislature. He recruited William Jennings Bryan to help campaign for the amendment's adoption in 1910. Arkansas is the only state in the American South to grant its citizens such power. The initiative, which began in South Dakota, is otherwise particularly known in California and Colorado.\n\nThe Donaghey administration focused on roads, public health, and railroads. Donaghey was vehemently opposed to the use of prisoners for contract-leased labor, especially for building railroads. He particularly learned about convict lease while at a Southern governors' conference in West Virginia in autumn 1912. Unable to get the legislature to abolish the practice, he prior to leaving office pardoned 360 prisoners, 44 in country farms and 316 out of 850 in penitentiaries and 37 percent of the incarcerated population. This left the lease system with insufficient available prisoners for utilization in construction. In 1913, a year after Donaghey left office, the legislature finally ended the practice and a new prison board was formed.\n\nIn 1912, he was eager for a third term, hoping to take care of statewide prohibition and the much-needed tax reform, but the legislature rejected his reforms and the electorate rejected his prohibition plans. During his campaign for the third term the state capitol project ran out of money, and Donaghey's appropriation plans were not successful. What also helped bring on his defeat was that former governor Jeff Davis and his allies also campaigned for governor, along with emerging powerbroker Joseph Taylor Robinson.\n\nDonaghey was the first Arkansas governor who could indisputably be labeled 'progressive' but was also within the southern progressive tradition, as well as the first businessman to become governor of Arkansas.\n\n== After being governor ==\nAfter his bid for a third term as governor was defeated by Joseph Taylor Robinson in 1912, Donaghey persisted in his quest to complete the Capitol. A critical year was 1913. Senator Jeff Davis died two days into the year. Robinson, by this time state governor, was named by the legislature as Davis's successor. J. M. Futtrell, president of the Arkansas Senate, became acting governor. The result was that Futtrell and the Capitol Building Commission asked Donaghey to become a commission member and take charge of completing construction, which he did. The Capitol, valued at more than $300 million today, was completed in 1917 for $2.2 million, ending an 18-year effort. As a hallmark to completion, Donaghey personally built the governor's conference table, which sets today as the centerpiece of the governor's conference room in the north wing of the Capitol.\n\nAs a former governor, Donaghey served on a number of boards and commissions responsible for a variety of tasks such as constructions, education, and charities. He penned the book Build a State Capitol, which details the construction of the Arkansas capitol building.\n\nDonaghey died from a heart attack in Little Rock in 1937, and is interred there at the Roselawn Memorial Park Cemetery. His estate is managed by George W. Donaghey Foundation in Little Rock.\n\nFormer Arkansas Governor (1949-1953) Sid McMath said in his memoir Promises Kept: a Memoir that Donaghey was \"without a doubt, one of the great governors of Arkansas and served as an inspiration to my administration and to others, particularly in the continuing struggle for human rights, and I decided to continue what he had begun\". One book called him \"arguably one of the best and most influential governors and philanthropists in Arkansas history\".\n\nIn 1999, the Log Cabin Democrat named him one of the ten most influential people in Faulkner County's history.\n\n== Donaghey's Monument ==\nIn 1931, Donaghey, who felt a kinship to both Arkansas and Louisiana, established a monument at the Union Parish/Union County state line near his birthplace. The Art Deco-style monument contains intricate carvings; it includes references to transportation in 1831 and 1931, and mentions Governor Huey P. Long, Jr., whose educational program Donaghey admired. The land was not registered with state parks offices in either state, timber companies cut trees around it, and the marker was forgotten.\n\nIn 1975, an employee of the Louisiana Department of Transportation came across the abandoned monument and informed then-State Representative Louise B. Johnson of Bernice of his discovery.\n\nThe Monument was dedicated in 1933; Donaghey died four years later. At one time there were plans for a Donaghey State Park, but these were never implemented.\"\"\""}

He entered military service in 1793 as a private in the Kuban Jaeger Corps, in whose ranks he participated in the Persian expedition of 1796, distinguished himself in the capture of Derbent and was promoted to officer for the battle near Alpan.\n\nAfter the disbandment of the Kuban Jaeger Corps, Lisanevich was enrolled in the 17th Jaeger Regiment, with which he moved to Georgia and here, under the command of Pavel Tsitsianov, Ivan Lazarev and Pavel Karyagin, he enrolled in an excellent military school. In 1803 he was already a major, and in 1804 for the assault on Ganja, during which, commanding a battalion with the rank of lieutenant colonel, he was the first to climb the city wall, was awarded the Order of St. George of the 4th degree. The capture of Ganja played an important role in accelerating the invasion of the Caucasian khanates by Russia. Back in early 1804, General Tsitsianov sent Lisanevich to Ibrahim Khalil Khan and demanded that transfer to Russian subordination. Ibrahim Khalil Khan asked Tsitsianov for military assistance to prevent the attack of Iranian troops and promised to help and remain loyal to Russia. At his request, Tsitsianov sent a team to Karabakh, led by Lisanevich. Tsitsianov set up camp on the Kurakchay River near Ganja. Ibrahim Khalil Khan came here with his sons Mammad Hasan agha, Mehdigulu Khan, Khanlar agha and other nobles of Karabakh.\n\nOn April 3, 1805, Lisanevich was appointed commander of the 17th Jaeger Regiment, on April 23, 1806, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and on December 12, 1807 - to colonel.\n\nLisanevich was involved in killing of Ibrahim Khalil Khan in 1806. Tsitsianov's death on 20 February 1806 in Baku and the breakup of the Russian offensive persuaded Ibrahim Khalil Khan, in the summer of 1806, to repudiate his allegiance to the Russians, and resubmit himself to the shah; he then asked the shah for aid in ousting the Russian garrison. As the Persian army approached Shusha, Ibrahim Khan left the fortress and camped outside. On 12 June 1806, the Russians under the command of Lisanevich, instigated by Ibrahim Khalil Khan's grandson and fearful of their own vulnerability, attacked the camp and killed Ibrahim Khan, one of his wives, a daughter, and his youngest son. Except for him being a traitor, Lisanevich didn't give any justification for the killing. As a result Lisanevich was transferred elsewhere.\n\nAppointed the chief of the 9th Jaeger Regiment, Lisanevich took a prominent part in the conquest of Imeretia, in 1810 he was a hero of the victory at Akhalkalaki and in the same year with two Jaeger companies pacified the Quba Khanate and rescued the Russian troops besieged in Quba. For these deeds he was awarded the Order of St. Vladimir 3rd degree, the rank of major general and a gold saber with the inscription \"For Bravery\" and diamond jewelry (July 9, 1811). He was nicknamed Dəli Mayor (\"Mad Major\" in Azerbaijani) by locals for his temper. On October 22, 1810 he was promoted to major general.\n\nTaking advantage of his free time from service, Lisanevich traveled, under an assumed name, accompanied by an interpreter, most of France and got acquainted with the laws and its internal administration. Upon his return from Maubeuge to Russia, he was appointed head of the 7th Infantry Division, and in September 1824, by the personal selection of Emperor Alexander I, he became commander of the troops on the Caucasian line and the head of the 22nd Infantry Division. In December of the same year, Lisanevich was promoted to lieutenant general.\n\nLisanevich arrived in the Caucasus in March 1825 and found the line in a difficult situation: the Circassians destroyed Russian colonies, Kabardia was engulfed in an uprising. As soon as Lisanevich began to pacify Kabarda, a riot broke out in Chechnya and threatened to stir up the whole of Dagestan. Lisanevich hurried to Chechnya to the rescue of the Gerzel-aul garrison, which was saved, but on July 18, 1825, General Nikolay Grekov was killed by the Kumyk mullah Uchar-hadji, and Lisanevich himself was mortally wounded.\n\n== Death ==\nThe date and place of Lisanevich's death differs in different sources, in a number of encyclopedic publications they are called July 18 (Military encyclopedia of Sytin, Encyclopedia of Military and Marine Sciences) and July 22 (RBD) in Gerzel-aul, Modest Bogdanovich claims that Lisanevich died on July 20, and Potto says that Lisanevich was transported to the Grozny fortress and died there on July 24; the place of his burial is unknown, both Grozny and Georgievsk are mentioned as his burial places.\n\n== Family ==\nHe was married to a member of a noble family of Armenian origin Ekaterina Semyonovna Ivanova.

With the popularization of mobile apps, diary or journaling apps have become available for iOS and Android. Proponents have cited numerous reasons for journaling using digital applications, including ease and speed of typing, mobile portability, and search capabilities. Digital diaries are also tailored towards shorter-form, in-the-moment writing, similar to user engagement with social media services such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\"\"\""}

For the 1961 rowing season, he teamed up with Dieter Bender in the coxless pair cause a sensation at their first regatta in Mannheim when they came second, by just 0.1 seconds, to the 1960 Olympic gold medallists in the coxed pair, Bernhard Knubel and Heinz Renneberg. Later that year, Zumkeller and Bender won the national championships in West Germany. This qualified them for the 1961 European Rowing Championships, where they won a gold medal in this boat class. In 1962, the again won at the national championships. This qualified the pair for the 1962 World Rowing Championships in Lucerne where they won a gold medal in the same boat class. In 1963, Zumkeller and Bender won the national championships for a third time in succession. As the International Rowing Federation (FISA) did not recognise East Germany as a country and insisted on one German team per boat class at international regattas, selection trials had to be held for the 1963 European Rowing Championships. Zumkeller and Bender won their selection trial against Jörg Lucke and Heinz-Jürgen Bothe by just 0.05 seconds. At the 1963 European Championships, Zumkeller and Bender won silver, beaten by the team from Italy.\n\nAt the 1964 national championships, Zumkeller and Bender came third. The winners of the national championships, Michael Schwan and Wolfgang Hottenrott, went on to become the German representatives in the coxless pair at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Zumkeller and Bender separated after the 1964 nationals, and Zumkeller joined Klaus-Günter Jordan to form a coxed pair. Jordan had previously been national champion in this boat class (1961 to 1963). They concentrated on getting the Olympic nomination for the United Team of Germany and did thus not go to the 1964 European Rowing Championships in Amsterdam. The European champions from Amsterdam were the East Germans Peter Gorny and Günter Bergau, with Karl-Heinz Danielowski as their cox. In the qualification race, the East Germans were in the lead and the West German team was catching up, but with 200 m to go, Jordan caught a crab. East German media claimed that even without this mishap, the East German team would still have won. In 1966, Zumkeller continued to row with Klaus-Günter Jordan in the coxed pair (the cox that year was Burkhard Zwosta), and they took out the title that year. This qualified them for the 1966 World Rowing Championships in Bled where they came in sixth place in the final.\n\n== Awards ==\nFor their 1961 European Championship title, Zumkeller and Bender received the Silbernes Lorbeerblatt (Silver Laurel Leaf), the highest sports award in Germany.

This company originally had no distribution deal producing films with various studios such as The Ladd Company, Columbia Pictures, TriStar Pictures, Warner Bros., Touchstone Pictures, Vestron Pictures, Universal Pictures and 20th Century Fox. This company produced films such as Once Upon a Time in America and Q&A. This company was shut down in 1991.\n\n== Regency Enterprises and New Regency Branding (1991–present) ==\nOn January 15, 1991, Milchan and Regency, as well as Scriba & Deyle of Germany and Canal+ of France, formed a $600 million joint venture to finance 20 films in five years, all of which were to be distributed by Warner Bros. Arnon Milchan rebranded Regency International Pictures to Regency Enterprises. A subsidiary company, New Regency Productions, was also created. Formerly with offices on the Warner Bros. lot, New Regency is currently located on the 20th Century Studios lot. New Regency primarily produces movies, and has at least 100 movies to its credit. New Regency produced 2013's 12 Years a Slave, 2014's Birdman, and 2015's The Revenant, which earned the company two Academy Awards for Best Picture in a row, and three nominations.\n\nFounder Arnon Milchan's daughter Alexandra Milchan headed their offshoot \"Regency Vision,\" originally intended as a competitor to companies like New Line Cinema's Fine Line Features, a \"specialty features\" division.\n\nOn March 24, 1999, New Regency executive David Matalon joined the supervisory board of Puma AG, an international sports company. At the time, Regency was the largest single shareholder in Puma, with more than a 25% stake. Arnon Milchan also owned Puma stock, which he later sold for $676 million in May 2003.\n\nOn September 9, 1997, Milchan signed a 15-year distribution pact with 20th Century Fox worldwide in all media outside of foreign television rights, ending a previous association with Warner Bros. (1991–1999). Fox's parent company News Corporation (now Walt Disney Studios) funneled $200 million in New Regency, in exchange for a 20% stake in the company. On January 17, 2011, Fox and New Regency extended the pact, to expire in 2022. In January 2019, New Regency re-formed its international sales team to take back control of its international television licensing activities. Having established a long-standing partnership with 20th Century Fox for its global theatrical distribution, the Walt Disney Company will now be handling the home entertainment and first pay rights. New Regency's sales team, led by Charlotte Thorp and primarily based out of London, UK will handle all other television and SVOD rights after the first pay window as well as other business development. The team, listed below will handle territories as specified, any other queries should be directed to Charlotte.\n\nOn May 21, 2008, they hired Hutch Parker as co-chairman of the studio. He left the post on January 11, 2012.\n\nThe Walt Disney Company inherited Fox's stake in Regency Enterprises and New Regency Productions after Disney acquired 21st Century Fox's assets on March 20, 2019. After Disney dropped the “Fox” name from the studio's 20th Century Fox and Fox Searchlight Pictures branding and the two studios were renamed 20th Century Studios and Searchlight Pictures, respectively on January 17, 2020, distribution of movies by Regency Enterprises transferred to Walt Disney Studios, in exchange for a 20% stake in the parent company. On December 13, 2021, New Regency renewed their global theatrical distribution deal with Disney.\n\n== New Regency Television International ==\nNew Regency Television International (formerly known as Regency Television) is a joint venture between Regency Enterprises and Fox Television Studios founded in 1998. Regency's best-known television shows include The WB/UPN sci-fi drama Roswell and the Fox sitcoms Malcolm in the Middle and The Bernie Mac Show.\n\nOn July 17, 2007, Regency Television shut down all production and closed its business after nine years in operation. On January 17, 2011, New Regency announced a return to the television business after 20th Century Fox extended its distribution business with Regency until 2022. When New Regency re-formed its international sales team to take back control of its international television licensing activities in January 2019, Warner Bros.

He was descended in an unbroken male line from Brochwel Ysgithrog through the Princes of Powys, Elisedd ap Cyngen and Ieuan, the older brother of Sir Gruffudd Vychan. His family had lived in Montgomeryshire for as long as records are available. His 19th century ancestors were active in the Welsh Methodist revival, one of whom married the Welsh hymn-writer Ann Griffiths. He was educated at Llanfyllin British School and The Oaks Institute, Liverpool. He married Florence Gethin in 1922 with whom he had his only child Barbara in the same year.\n\n== Dairy farming ==\nDuring World War I he started farming a rented 99 acre hill farm at Garthllwyd with six Blue Albion milking cows and a hand-operated separator. As the herd grew, he was unsatisfied by the low price he could get for his milk locally, so started to produce cream that he sold to Harrods in London. In 1926 he moved to a larger farm, Woodlands at Forden, Powys where he renovated the farm buildings and equipment, enlarged his herd, improved their productivity and then expanded further by renting other farms in the area. By 1937 R.W. Griffiths was milking cows on 900 acres (3.6 km2). In the 1950s he bought Woodlands and then the 2,000-acre (8.1 km2) Walcot Estate near Lydbury North from the Earl of Powis, which had come into his family when Robert Clive purchased it on his return from India in 1760.\n\nR.W. Griffiths built up his prize winning Montgomery Herd of tubercular tested pedigree Friesian cows at Woodlands by introducing bulls from as far away as the Netherlands and Canada. To further his pedigree breeding plans he became a partner in one of the first artificial insemination and progeny testing companies in the UK. In 1961 he won the Royal Welsh Agricultural Society's coveted Sir Bryner Jones Memorial Award for an exceptional contribution to dairy farming in Wales.\n\nHe was a prominent member of the National Farmer's Union, and a member of the regional Committee of the Milk Marketing Scheme when it was established in the 1930s – later to become Dairy Crest. He was a council member of the Royal Welsh Agricultural Society responsible for the establishment of the permanent grounds for the Royal Welsh Show at Llanelwedd near Builth Wells in mid Wales. Because of his interest in the future of agriculture he became a governor of the University of Wales, Aberystwyth, and a member of the Agricultural Research Council, following one of whose meetings in London he died in 1962.\n\n== National Milk Bars ==\nR.W. Griffiths founded Direct TT Supplies Ltd in 1933 to market the milk products of his farms directly to the public through National Milk Bars. The bars had black and white chequered floors, jukeboxes and gleaming chrome fixtures, with stools beside bars selling milk and related products. At the end of World War II he was operating 11 milk bars and the Four Crosses Creamery, Llanymynech – later operated by Dairy Crest. At their height, there were 17 National Milk Bars in North Wales and North West England where 65% of the milk, cream, pigmeat, eggs, bread and confectionery sold came from R.W.

The record slows down in the last track with the ballad \"What Do I Know of Holy\", which Jesus Freak Hideout labeled as lyrically \"bringing out a deeper side of the band that was previously unheard earlier on the debut\".\n\n== Release ==\nIn November 2007, Addison Road was originally scheduled to be released in the week of February 26, 2008. It reached #182 on the Billboard 200 within its first few weeks of release on March 18, 2008.\n\nThe album's first single, \"All That Matters\", was released early in January 2008, and quickly generated big success on Christian radio charts. It had reached the top ten on R&R's Christian chart by early February 2008, only five weeks later. For the week of February 12–19, the song was available as a free Discovery Download on iTunes and was downloaded over 165,000 times. \"All That Matters\" was given an exclusive stream on Napster's website for the week of March 10, 2008, and was featured on a handpicked Addison Road playlist of the band's favorite songs; this was unprecedented for a debut Christian music act. It was the ninth most-played song on R&R magazine's Christian chart for 2008.\n\nThe second single from the album, \"Sticking with You\", was released in mid-2008 and reached number two on R&R's Christian chart on October 17, 2008. The third hit single from the album, \"Hope Now\", was the theme song for the movie Letters to God. It ended 2008 as the fifteenth most-played song for the year on R&R magazine's Christian chart.\n\n== Critical reception ==\nAddison Road received generally positive reception from music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic gave it four stars writing that \"At times, the group musters up enough energy and hooks to have a passing resemblance to Avril Lavigne, but this is hardly trash punk-pop: it's big music even at its quietest moments, and what's endearing about the group is that their utter sincerity is matched by a natural melodicism and sturdy songwriting, qualities that are easy to appreciate regardless of religious denomination.\" At New Release Tuesday, Sarah Fine gave it four-and-a-half stars praising the \"Fresh beats and the consistent message of hope running through the album are sure to leave any listener satisfied.\" Kevin Davis also of New Release Tuesday rated it three-and-a-half stars noting that \"Jenny Simmons has a nice voice and this is a promising debut album.\" At Cross Rhythms, Julie Porter rated it eight out of ten noting \"the finely crafted songwriting, tight musicianship and the beautiful, distinctive vocals of Jenny Simmons leave you wanting to have this album on repeat so you can capture every last drop!\" Liz Zelinski of Christian Music Review gave it a score of 91 percent, writing that \"Addison Road has created an eclectic project, with wide-ranging rhythm that is entertaining and thoughtful.\" At Soul Shine magazine, Lindsay Whitfield rated it four-and-a-half stars calling it \"a seriously insightful and musically brilliant recording\".\n\nAt CCM magazine, Lizza Connor Bowen gave it three stars stating that the music uses too many rote metaphors and calling the lyrics simplistically direct in the \"upbeat anthems of exhortation and encouragement.\" Garrett DeRossett of Jesus Freak Hideout gave it three stars commenting that the band had \"produced a fine debut\", but only \"If they had attempted to step outside the box just a bit more, it would've made a world of difference.\" At Christianity Today, Christa Banister rated it two stars cautioning that \"Addison Road plays it much too safe to really make much of a memorable impact. Instead of embracing the scrappy and creative underdog spirit of a band who's fought so hard to make it, Addison Road takes the well-traveled road, making their debut just another so-so effort with a positive message. They're capable of much more than this.\"\n\n== Personnel ==\nAdapted from AllMusic.\"\"\""}

They received initial support from the San Francisco Baking Institute, which agreed to provide training and equipment at cost.

Food Service classes take place at the Berkeley Unified School District's Berkeley Adult School, and Bakery Production classes happen at the former Semifreddi's Bakery location in Emeryville, California.\n\n== Partnerships and Placement Support ==\nThe Bread Project works closely with local food employers to identify the skills they expect, and adjusts curricula accordingly. These relationships are also used to find opportunities for graduates and directly place them into jobs whenever possible. A 3-month intensive job development period is activated upon program graduation, where graduates are engaged via an incentive reporting and mentorship program to provide ongoing support and coaching.

After all else fails, it sends the dilemma of the fleet's impossible disappearance to several citizens of the world of Path. Path's culture centers on the godspoken – those who hear the voices of the gods in the form of irresistible compulsions, and are capable of significantly superior intelligence. It later becomes clear that the godspoken of Path are victims of a cruel government project: granted great intelligence by genetic modification, they were also shackled with a form of obsessive-compulsive disorder to control their loyalty. The experiment is set in a culture bound by five dictates - obey the gods, honor the ancestors, love the people, serve the rulers, then serve your self. This is a further safeguard against rebellion. The superintelligent godspoken are considered the most devout and holy of all citizens, and any disloyal thoughts in a godspoken's mind are immediately suppressed by overwhelming obsessive-compulsive behavior, believed to be a sign from the gods the thoughts are wrong. The most respected godspoken on Path is Han Fei-Tzu, for devising a treaty to prevent the rebellion of several colony worlds after the articles published by Demosthenes. Great things are expected of his daughter and potential successor Han Qing-jao, \"Gloriously Bright\". While doubting the existence of the gods himself, Han Fei-Tzu promised his dying wife he would raise Qing-jao with an unwavering belief in the godspoken. The two of them are tasked by Starways Congress with deciphering the disappearance of the Lusitania Fleet. Han Qing-jao's secret maid, Si Wang-mu, aids her in this task, her intelligence (partially) unfettered by the rigid caste system.\n\nQing-jao eventually traces the identity of Demosthenes. Discovering that Demosthenes is Valentine Wiggin, Ender's sister – but that Valentine has been on a starship en route to Lusitania for the last thirty years – Qing-Jao concludes that the only possible explanation is advanced computer software closely tied to the communication network. This software must be hiding Demosthenes and publishing her work, while also causing the disappearance of the Fleet. All but discovered, Jane reveals herself to Han Fei-tzu, Han Qing-jao and Si Wang-mu, telling them about their genetic slavery and begging forbearance on their report to Starways Congress.\n\nAlready harboring suspicions about the godspoken's condition, Han Fei-tzu accepts the news of Congress's atrocity, as does Si Wang-mu, but his daughter Han Qing-jao clings to her belief that Demosthenes and Jane are enemies of the gods. Feeling betrayed by her father, who is violently incapacitated by OCD from the disloyal thoughts, Qing-jao argues with Jane. Jane threatens shutting off all communications from Path, but Si Wang-mu realizes this would eventually lead to the planet's destruction by Starways Congress. Understanding Jane to be truly alive and compassionate, through tears Si Wang-mu states Jane will not block the report. However, Qing-jao compares Jane to the servants in Path's caste system, merely a computer program designed to serve humans, containing neither autonomy nor awareness.\n\nKnowing she has exhausted her last possibilities of stopping Qing-jao, Jane sacrifices her future and life, unwilling to bring harm to Qing-jao or the people of Path. A triumphant Qing-jao reports the knowledge of Demosthenes, Jane, and the fate of the Fleet to Starways Congress. Qing-jao recommends a coordinated date set several months from the present, to prepare the massive undertaking of setting up clean computers across the interplanetary network, after which the transition to a new system will kill Jane and allow Congress full control again. Allowing the message to be sent, Jane restores communication with the Fleet, and Congress re-issues the order for the Fleet to obliterate Lusitania.\n\n== Publication ==\n\"Gloriously Bright\" was published in the January 1991 issue of Analog Science Fiction and Fact. \"Gloriously Bright\" is reprinted as parts of Chapters 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 of Xenocide. It also includes about 20 paragraphs recounting Jane’s story from Speaker for the Dead that are not republished anywhere else.", "src": "== Plot summary ==\nStarways Congress wants its fleet back.

They show mostly a coccobacillary morphology on nonselective agar. Rods predominate in fluid media, especially during early growth.\n\nThe morphology of Acinetobacter species can be quite variable in Gram-stained human clinical specimens, and cannot be used to differentiate Acinetobacter from other common causes of infection.\n\nMost strains of Acinetobacter, except some of the A. lwoffii strain, grow well on MacConkey agar (without salt). Although officially classified as not lactose-fermenting, they are often partially lactose-fermenting when grown on MacConkey agar. They are oxidase-negative, catalase-positive, indole-negative, nonmotile, and usually nitrate-negative.\n\nBacteria of the genus Acinetobacter are known to form intracellular inclusions of polyhydroxyalkanoates under certain environmental conditions (e.g. lack of elements such as phosphorus, nitrogen, or oxygen combined with an excessive supply of carbon sources).\n\n== Etymology ==\nAcinetobacter is a compound word from scientific Greek [α + κίνητο + βακτηρ(ία)], meaning nonmotile rod. The first element acineto- appears as a somewhat baroque rendering of the Greek morpheme ακίνητο-, commonly transliterated in English is akineto-, but actually stems from the French cinetique and was adopted directly into English.\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThe genus Acinetobacter comprises 38 validly named species.\n\n== Identification ==\nIdentification of Acinetobacter species is complicated by lack of standard identification techniques. Initially, identification was based on phenotypic characteristics such as growth temperature, colony morphology, growth medium, carbon sources, gelatin hydrolysis, glucose fermentation, among others. This method allowed identification of A. calcoaceticus–A. baumannii complex by the formation of smooth, rounded, mucoid colonies at 37 °C. Closely related species could not be differentiated and individual species such as A. baumannii and Acinetobacter genomic species 3 could not be positively identified phenotypically.\n\nBecause routine identification in the clinical microbiology laboratory is not yet possible, Acinetobacter isolates are divided and grouped into three main complexes:\n\nDifferent species of bacteria in this genus can be identified using fluorescence-lactose-denitrification to find the amount of acid produced by metabolism of glucose. The other reliable identification test at genus level is chromosomal DNA transformation assay. In this assay, a naturally competent tryptophan auxotrophic mutant of Acinetobacter baylyi (BD4 trpE27) is transformed with the total DNA of a putative Acinetobacter isolate and the transformation mixture is plated on a brain heart infusion agar. The growth is then harvested after incubation for 24 h at 30 °C, plating on an Acinetobacter minimal agar (AMA), and incubating at 30 °C for 108 h. Growth on the AMA indicates a positive transformation assay and confirms the isolate as a member of the genus Acinetobacter. E. coli HB101 and A. calcoaceticus MTCC1921T can be used as the negative and positive controls, respectively.\n\nSome of the molecular methods used in species identification are repetitive extragenic palindromic sequence-based PCR, ribotyping, pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), random amplified polymorphic DNA, amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), restriction and sequence analysis of tRNA and 16S-23S rRNA gene spacers and amplified 16S ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA). PFGE, AFLP, and ARDRA are validated common methods in use today because of their discriminative ability. However, most recent methods include multilocus sequence typing and multilocus PCR and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, which are based on amplification of highly conserved housekeeping genes and can be used to study the genetic relatedness between different isolates.\n\n== Habitat ==\nAcinetobacter species are widely distributed in nature, and commonly occur in soil and water. Their ability to survive on moist and dry surfaces, as well as to survive exposure to various common disinfectants, allows some Acinetobacter species to survive in a hospital environment. Furthermore, Acinetobacter species can grow at a broad range of temperatures, allowing them to survive in a broad array of environments.\n\n== Clinical significance ==\nAcinetobacter is frequently isolated in nosocomial infections, and is especially prevalent in intensive care units, where both sporadic cases and epidemic and endemic occurrences are common. A. baumannii is a frequent cause of hospital-acquired pneumonia, especially of late-onset, ventilator-associated pneumonia. It can cause various other infections, including skin and wound infections, bacteremia, and meningitis, but A. lwoffi is mostly responsible for the latter.\n\nOf the Acinetobacter, A. baumannii is the greatest cause of human disease, having been implicated in a number of hospital-acquired infections such as bacteremia, urinary tract infections (UTIs), secondary meningitis, infective endocarditis, and wound and burn infections. In particular, A. baumannii is frequently isolated as the cause of hospital-acquired pneumonia among patients admitted to the intensive care unit. Risk factors include long-term intubation and tracheal or lung aspiration. In most cases of ventilator-associated pneumonia, the equipment used for artificial ventilation such as endotracheal tubes or bronchoscopes serve as the source of infection and result in the colonization of the lower respiratory tract by A. baumannii. In some cases, the bacteria can go on to enter the bloodstream, resulting in bacteremia with mortality rates ranging from 32% to 52%. UTIs caused by A. baumannii appear to be associated with continuous catheterization, as well as antibiotic therapy. A. baumannii has also been reported to infect skin and soft tissue in traumatic injuries and postsurgical wounds. A. baumannii commonly infect burns and may result in complications owing to difficulty in treatment and eradication. Though less common, some evidence also links this bacterium to meningitis, most often following invasive surgery, and, in very rare cases, to community-acquired primary meningitis wherein the majority of the victims were children. Case reports also link A. baumannii to endocarditis, keratitis, peritonitis, and very rarely fatal neonatal sepsis.\n\nThe clinical significance of A. baumannii is partially due to its capacity to develop resistance against many available antibiotics. Reports indicate that it possesses resistance against broad-spectrum cephalosporins, β-lactam antibiotics, aminoglycosides, and quinolones. Resistance to carbapenems is also being increasingly reported. A. baumannii can survive on the human skin or dry surfaces for weeks and is resistant to a variety of disinfectants, making it particularly easy to spread in a hospital setting. Antibiotic resistance genes are often plasmid-borne, and plasmids present in Acinetobacter strains can be transferred to other pathogenic bacteria by horizontal gene transfer.\n\nIn healthy individuals, Acinetobacter colonies on the skin correlate with low incidence of allergies; Acinetobacter is thought to be allergy-protective.\n\n== Treatment ==\nAcinetobacter species are innately resistant to many classes of antibiotics, including penicillin, chloramphenicol, and often aminoglycosides. Resistance to fluoroquinolones has been reported during therapy, which has also resulted in increased resistance to other drug classes mediated through active drug efflux. A dramatic increase in antibiotic resistance in Acinetobacter strains has been reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the carbapenems are recognised as the gold-standard and treatment of last resort. Acinetobacter species are unusual in that they are sensitive to sulbactam, which is commonly used to inhibit bacterial beta-lactamase, but this is an example of the antibacterial property of sulbactam itself. Recently sulbactam-durlobactam, a new antibacterial combination undergoing phase 3 trial, has demonstrated good in vitro activity also against carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii isolates (92% susceptibility).\n\nIn November 2004, the CDC reported an increasing number of A. baumannii bloodstream infections in patients at military medical facilities in which service members injured in the Iraq/Kuwait region during Operation Iraqi Freedom and in Afghanistan during Operation Enduring Freedom were treated. Most of these were multidrug-resistant. Among one set of isolates from Walter Reed Army Medical Center, 13 (35%) were susceptible to imipenem only, and two (4%) were resistant to all drugs tested. One antimicrobial agent, colistin (polymyxin E), has been used to treat infections with multidrug-resistant A. baumannii; however, antimicrobial susceptibility testing for colistin was not performed on isolates described in this report. Because A. baumannii can survive on dry surfaces up to 20 days, they pose a high risk of spread and contamination in hospitals, potentially putting immunocompromised and other patients at risk for drug-resistant infections that are often fatal and, in general, expensive to treat. Trials to implement vaccines to prevent Acinetobacter infections were documented.\n\nReports suggest this bacterium is susceptible to phage therapy.\n\nGene-silencing antisense oligomers in a form called peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers have also been reported to inhibit growth in tests carried out in animals infected with antibiotic-resistant A. baumannii.\n\n== Aseptic technique ==\nThe frequency of nosocomial infections in British hospitals prompted the National Health Service to research the effectiveness of anions for air purification, finding that repeated airborne Acinetobacter infections in a ward were eliminated by the installation of a negative air ioniser—the infection rate fell to zero.\n\n== Natural transformation ==\nBacterial transformation involves the transfer of DNA from a donor to a recipient bacterium through the intervening liquid medium. Recipient bacteria must first enter a special physiological state termed competence to receive donor DNA. A. calcoaceticus is induced to become competent for natural transformation by dilution of a stationary culture into fresh nutrient medium. Competence is gradually lost during prolonged exponential growth and for a period after entrance into the stationary state. The DNA taken up may be used to repair DNA damage or as a means to exchange genetic information by horizontal gene transfer. Natural transformation in A. calcoaceticus may protect against exposure to DNA-damaging conditions in the natural environment of these bacteria, as appears to be the case for other bacterial species capable of transformation.", "src": "== Description ==\nSpecies of the genus Acinetobacter are strictly aerobic, nonfermentative, Gram-negative bacilli.

They show mostly a coccobacillary morphology on nonselective agar. Rods predominate in fluid media, especially during early growth.\n\nThe morphology of Acinetobacter species can be quite variable in Gram-stained human clinical specimens, and cannot be used to differentiate Acinetobacter from other common causes of infection.\n\nMost strains of Acinetobacter, except some of the A. lwoffii strain, grow well on MacConkey agar (without salt). Although officially classified as not lactose-fermenting, they are often partially lactose-fermenting when grown on MacConkey agar. They are oxidase-negative, catalase-positive, indole-negative, nonmotile, and usually nitrate-negative.\n\nBacteria of the genus Acinetobacter are known to form intracellular inclusions of polyhydroxyalkanoates under certain environmental conditions (e.g. lack of elements such as phosphorus, nitrogen, or oxygen combined with an excessive supply of carbon sources).\n\n== Etymology ==\nAcinetobacter is a compound word from scientific Greek [α + κίνητο + βακτηρ(ία)], meaning nonmotile rod. The first element acineto- appears as a somewhat baroque rendering of the Greek morpheme ακίνητο-, commonly transliterated in English is akineto-, but actually stems from the French cinetique and was adopted directly into English.\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nThe genus Acinetobacter comprises 38 validly named species.\n\n== Identification ==\nIdentification of Acinetobacter species is complicated by lack of standard identification techniques. Initially, identification was based on phenotypic characteristics such as growth temperature, colony morphology, growth medium, carbon sources, gelatin hydrolysis, glucose fermentation, among others. This method allowed identification of A. calcoaceticus–A. baumannii complex by the formation of smooth, rounded, mucoid colonies at 37 °C. Closely related species could not be differentiated and individual species such as A. baumannii and Acinetobacter genomic species 3 could not be positively identified phenotypically.\n\nBecause routine identification in the clinical microbiology laboratory is not yet possible, Acinetobacter isolates are divided and grouped into three main complexes:\n\nDifferent species of bacteria in this genus can be identified using fluorescence-lactose-denitrification to find the amount of acid produced by metabolism of glucose. The other reliable identification test at genus level is chromosomal DNA transformation assay. In this assay, a naturally competent tryptophan auxotrophic mutant of Acinetobacter baylyi (BD4 trpE27) is transformed with the total DNA of a putative Acinetobacter isolate and the transformation mixture is plated on a brain heart infusion agar. The growth is then harvested after incubation for 24 h at 30 °C, plating on an Acinetobacter minimal agar (AMA), and incubating at 30 °C for 108 h. Growth on the AMA indicates a positive transformation assay and confirms the isolate as a member of the genus Acinetobacter. E. coli HB101 and A. calcoaceticus MTCC1921T can be used as the negative and positive controls, respectively.\n\nSome of the molecular methods used in species identification are repetitive extragenic palindromic sequence-based PCR, ribotyping, pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), random amplified polymorphic DNA, amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), restriction and sequence analysis of tRNA and 16S-23S rRNA gene spacers and amplified 16S ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA). PFGE, AFLP, and ARDRA are validated common methods in use today because of their discriminative ability. However, most recent methods include multilocus sequence typing and multilocus PCR and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, which are based on amplification of highly conserved housekeeping genes and can be used to study the genetic relatedness between different isolates.\n\n== Habitat ==\nAcinetobacter species are widely distributed in nature, and commonly occur in soil and water. Their ability to survive on moist and dry surfaces, as well as to survive exposure to various common disinfectants, allows some Acinetobacter species to survive in a hospital environment. Furthermore, Acinetobacter species can grow at a broad range of temperatures, allowing them to survive in a broad array of environments.\n\n== Clinical significance ==\nAcinetobacter is frequently isolated in nosocomial infections, and is especially prevalent in intensive care units, where both sporadic cases and epidemic and endemic occurrences are common. A. baumannii is a frequent cause of hospital-acquired pneumonia, especially of late-onset, ventilator-associated pneumonia. It can cause various other infections, including skin and wound infections, bacteremia, and meningitis, but A. lwoffi is mostly responsible for the latter.\n\nOf the Acinetobacter, A. baumannii is the greatest cause of human disease, having been implicated in a number of hospital-acquired infections such as bacteremia, urinary tract infections (UTIs), secondary meningitis, infective endocarditis, and wound and burn infections. In particular, A. baumannii is frequently isolated as the cause of hospital-acquired pneumonia among patients admitted to the intensive care unit. Risk factors include long-term intubation and tracheal or lung aspiration. In most cases of ventilator-associated pneumonia, the equipment used for artificial ventilation such as endotracheal tubes or bronchoscopes serve as the source of infection and result in the colonization of the lower respiratory tract by A. baumannii. In some cases, the bacteria can go on to enter the bloodstream, resulting in bacteremia with mortality rates ranging from 32% to 52%. UTIs caused by A. baumannii appear to be associated with continuous catheterization, as well as antibiotic therapy. A. baumannii has also been reported to infect skin and soft tissue in traumatic injuries and postsurgical wounds. A. baumannii commonly infect burns and may result in complications owing to difficulty in treatment and eradication. Though less common, some evidence also links this bacterium to meningitis, most often following invasive surgery, and, in very rare cases, to community-acquired primary meningitis wherein the majority of the victims were children. Case reports also link A. baumannii to endocarditis, keratitis, peritonitis, and very rarely fatal neonatal sepsis.\n\nThe clinical significance of A. baumannii is partially due to its capacity to develop resistance against many available antibiotics. Reports indicate that it possesses resistance against broad-spectrum cephalosporins, β-lactam antibiotics, aminoglycosides, and quinolones. Resistance to carbapenems is also being increasingly reported. A. baumannii can survive on the human skin or dry surfaces for weeks and is resistant to a variety of disinfectants, making it particularly easy to spread in a hospital setting. Antibiotic resistance genes are often plasmid-borne, and plasmids present in Acinetobacter strains can be transferred to other pathogenic bacteria by horizontal gene transfer.\n\nIn healthy individuals, Acinetobacter colonies on the skin correlate with low incidence of allergies; Acinetobacter is thought to be allergy-protective.\n\n== Treatment ==\nAcinetobacter species are innately resistant to many classes of antibiotics, including penicillin, chloramphenicol, and often aminoglycosides. Resistance to fluoroquinolones has been reported during therapy, which has also resulted in increased resistance to other drug classes mediated through active drug efflux. A dramatic increase in antibiotic resistance in Acinetobacter strains has been reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the carbapenems are recognised as the gold-standard and treatment of last resort. Acinetobacter species are unusual in that they are sensitive to sulbactam, which is commonly used to inhibit bacterial beta-lactamase, but this is an example of the antibacterial property of sulbactam itself. Recently sulbactam-durlobactam, a new antibacterial combination undergoing phase 3 trial, has demonstrated good in vitro activity also against carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii isolates (92% susceptibility).\n\nIn November 2004, the CDC reported an increasing number of A. baumannii bloodstream infections in patients at military medical facilities in which service members injured in the Iraq/Kuwait region during Operation Iraqi Freedom and in Afghanistan during Operation Enduring Freedom were treated. Most of these were multidrug-resistant. Among one set of isolates from Walter Reed Army Medical Center, 13 (35%) were susceptible to imipenem only, and two (4%) were resistant to all drugs tested. One antimicrobial agent, colistin (polymyxin E), has been used to treat infections with multidrug-resistant A. baumannii; however, antimicrobial susceptibility testing for colistin was not performed on isolates described in this report. Because A. baumannii can survive on dry surfaces up to 20 days, they pose a high risk of spread and contamination in hospitals, potentially putting immunocompromised and other patients at risk for drug-resistant infections that are often fatal and, in general, expensive to treat. Trials to implement vaccines to prevent Acinetobacter infections were documented.\n\nReports suggest this bacterium is susceptible to phage therapy.\n\nGene-silencing antisense oligomers in a form called peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers have also been reported to inhibit growth in tests carried out in animals infected with antibiotic-resistant A. baumannii.\n\n== Aseptic technique ==\nThe frequency of nosocomial infections in British hospitals prompted the National Health Service to research the effectiveness of anions for air purification, finding that repeated airborne Acinetobacter infections in a ward were eliminated by the installation of a negative air ioniser—the infection rate fell to zero.\n\n== Natural transformation ==\nBacterial transformation involves the transfer of DNA from a donor to a recipient bacterium through the intervening liquid medium. Recipient bacteria must first enter a special physiological state termed competence to receive donor DNA. A. calcoaceticus is induced to become competent for natural transformation by dilution of a stationary culture into fresh nutrient medium. Competence is gradually lost during prolonged exponential growth and for a period after entrance into the stationary state. The DNA taken up may be used to repair DNA damage or as a means to exchange genetic information by horizontal gene transfer. Natural transformation in A. calcoaceticus may protect against exposure to DNA-damaging conditions in the natural environment of these bacteria, as appears to be the case for other bacterial species capable of transformation.\"\"\""}

Its name is something of a misnomer, because it was never located near the center of Knoxville, even when Fountain City was annexed into Knoxville in the early 1960s. The northernmost high school in Knoxville before the annexation of Fountain City was Fulton, and in the county, Powell, Karns, and Halls high schools were farther north.\n\n== 2008 shooting ==\nOn August 21, 2008, 15-year-old student Jamar Siler entered the school cafeteria and approached student Ryan McDonald sitting at a lunch table. Siler fatally shot McDonald, and was arrested by authorities a short time later. The two had been in previous altercations, the details of which were not released to the general public. Siler was then taken into custody.\n\nSiler was initially tried as a juvenile until Tim Irwin, Juvenile Court judge, ordered that he be tried as an adult. In November 2011, at age 18, Siler pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and received a 30-year sentence. Siler is currently incarcerated in the Trousdale Turner Correctional Center.\"\"\""}

{"id": 1918, "revid": "1111304028", "src_inf": "== Germany ==\nWhilst the Hunsrück region of Germany is well-defined, the distribution of Hunsrückisch itself is less so. On the one hand, the dialect extends beyond the Hunsrück area, but there are clear linguistic differences between the Hunsrückisch spoken in one locality and in another, and no uniform form of the dialect exists. That is made more difficult by the lack of written resources for the dialect. Since the 1990s, there has been an ongoing attempt to more scientifically document local dialects in the Mittelrheinischer Sprachatlas. The Rheinisches Wörterbuch entries of 1928-1971 have also been fully digitalised since then by the University of Trier.\n\nAs with almost all German dialects, the Hunsrückische dialect can be subdivided into many small local dialects, which each village having its own strand. The small-scale divisions of this linguistic area stem from how kingdoms in the Hunsrück area were often divided with borders that even cut through villages. The religious divisions in the predominantly protestant or catholic areas also contributed towards this linguistic separation.\n\nA considerable and accelerated reversal of the active use of the Hunsrückisch dialect has also been noted. Younger generations sometimes no longer speak dialect and rarely understand unique words pertinent to that dialect. Societies dedicated to preserving local culture and history, as well as individuals themselves, have been trying to stem this trend via modern communication and documentation methods.\n\n== Brazil ==\nThere is a variation of the dialect in southern Brazil and in the southeastern state of Espírito Santo (municipalities of Marechal Floriano, Domingos Martins and Santa Leopoldina), named Hunsrik German.\n\nThroughout its almost 200-year history in Southern Brazil and Espírito Santo, Hunsrückisch has been greatly influenced by other German dialects such as East Pomeranian, Swabian, and Austro-Bavarian; by other immigrant languages; and by Portuguese. Through Brazilian Portuguese, it has also incorporated Amerindian terminology, notably for fauna, flora and toponyms.\n\nBrazilian Hunsrik is spoken in the states of Rio Grande do Sul, the nearby state of Santa Catarina, in other parts of southern Brazil like Paraná, and in the Southeast region such as Espírito Santo and São Paulo. It's the second most spoken language in Brazil, after Portuguese.\n\n== Phonology ==\nHunsrückisch can roughly be classed under two dialect sub-groups. The first of these is the Rhenish Franconian languages, for Hunsrückisch spoken from the Nahe (Rhine) until approximately just beyond Kastellaun. The second of these groups is Moselle Franconian, for Hunsrückisch spoken between Kastellaun and Moselle. The main linguistic characteristic which separates these two groups of Hunsrückisch is the dat/das divide. In the North, such as in Idar-Oberstein, Gemünden, Kirchberg, and Boppard, the definite article is pronounced dat. Roland Martin states, however, that a more important division between the groups is his proposed Bad Sobernheim Isogloss which focuses on the east and west. To the east, one hears Herrd (Hirte, \"shepherd)\", Gorrjel (Gurgel, \"throat\"), and Rerre (Räder, \"wheels\"), whereas to the west Heerd, Goorjel, and Rierer are heard. Palatalization also occurs, with Dorf (village) becoming Dooref, Kirche (church) becoming Keerisch, and Berg (mountain) becoming Beerisch.\n\nGeorg Diener references other phonetic differences in different isoglosses. For example, in the west of Hunsrück o and eu are used, with u and au being used in the region east of the Mastershausen-Buch-Mannebach-Nörtershausen line: Bruure (Bruder, \"brother\"), Hau (Heu, \"hay\"). In the near east such as in Bubach, but not in Simmern, r is also pronounced as an apical consonant.\n\nIn Hunsrückisch d/t is often replaced with r, such as in Peere for Peter, or Fäärerre for Federn (feathers). When appearing between two vowels g is not pronounced, hence Aue (Augen \"eyes\") and saan (sagen \"to say\"). The dialect is also notable for its openness of the mouth when being spoken, as evident in a local saying from Bubach:\n\n== Grammar ==\nThe grammatical rules of Hunsrückisch resemble that of Standard German.\n\n== Gender ==\nIn contrast to the Standard language, Bach (stream) and Salat (salad) are feminine and not masculine — die Bach, die Salaad instead of der Bach, der Salat. Feminine die Brille (glasses) and die Butter become masculine de Brill and de Bodder in Hunsrückisch.\n\nFemale referents are usually of the masculine gender, such as de Marri (Maria), de Suffi (Sophia). Die Fraa (Frau \"woman\") becomes neuter, like in dat Fraamensch (lit. \"the woman-human\"), when appended with -mensch. Diminutives of women's names are also neuter like in Standard German — dat Kattche (Katharina) — but are also often complemented with the name of the locality in which they reside, or with a family name.\n\n== Tenses ==\nIn Hunsrückisch the perfect tenses are predominantly used. The preterite is reserved for only a small number of verbs, such as saht (sagte \"said\") and fung (fing, \"caught\"). Conjugation largely occurs on the basis of Standard German conjugation.\n\n== Cases ==\nAs is extant in Standard German, the Nominative, Accusative, and Dative are present in Hunsrückisch. The genitive case, as often comes to be in German dialects, is not used and is replaced with the dative. Thus dessen Bruder becomes dämm seine Brorer.\n\n== Plural Formation ==\nIn all cases except one, plural formation is identical to that of Standard German. The only exception occurs when the Standard German plural form is -en, in which case the plural in Hunsrückisch is -e.\n\n== Regionalisms ==\nA number of words occur in Hunsrückisch which are either not found in Standard German, or occur rarely/in different contexts in Standard German.\n\n== Other influences ==\nBecause of its proximity to France, the Hunsrückisch dialect spoken in the Hunsrück region has experienced unique influences from the neighbouring French through the centuries. During Napoleonic times, the Hunsrück region was briefly incorporated into France.", "src": "== Germany ==\nWhilst the Hunsrück region of Germany is well-defined, the distribution of Hunsrückisch itself is less so.

Roland Martin states, however, that a more important division between the groups is his proposed Bad Sobernheim Isogloss which focuses on the east and west. To the east, one hears Herrd (Hirte, \"shepherd)\", Gorrjel (Gurgel, \"throat\"), and Rerre (Räder, \"wheels\"), whereas to the west Heerd, Goorjel, and Rierer are heard. Palatalization also occurs, with Dorf (village) becoming Dooref, Kirche (church) becoming Keerisch, and Berg (mountain) becoming Beerisch.\n\nGeorg Diener references other phonetic differences in different isoglosses. For example, in the west of Hunsrück o and eu are used, with u and au being used in the region east of the Mastershausen-Buch-Mannebach-Nörtershausen line: Bruure (Bruder, \"brother\"), Hau (Heu, \"hay\"). In the near east such as in Bubach, but not in Simmern, r is also pronounced as an apical consonant.\n\nIn Hunsrückisch d/t is often replaced with r, such as in Peere for Peter, or Fäärerre for Federn (feathers). When appearing between two vowels g is not pronounced, hence Aue (Augen \"eyes\") and saan (sagen \"to say\"). The dialect is also notable for its openness of the mouth when being spoken, as evident in a local saying from Bubach:\n\n== Grammar ==\nThe grammatical rules of Hunsrückisch resemble that of Standard German.\n\n== Gender ==\nIn contrast to the Standard language, Bach (stream) and Salat (salad) are feminine and not masculine — die Bach, die Salaad instead of der Bach, der Salat. Feminine die Brille (glasses) and die Butter become masculine de Brill and de Bodder in Hunsrückisch.\n\nFemale referents are usually of the masculine gender, such as de Marri (Maria), de Suffi (Sophia). Die Fraa (Frau \"woman\") becomes neuter, like in dat Fraamensch (lit. \"the woman-human\"), when appended with -mensch. Diminutives of women's names are also neuter like in Standard German — dat Kattche (Katharina) — but are also often complemented with the name of the locality in which they reside, or with a family name.\n\n== Tenses ==\nIn Hunsrückisch the perfect tenses are predominantly used. The preterite is reserved for only a small number of verbs, such as saht (sagte \"said\") and fung (fing, \"caught\"). Conjugation largely occurs on the basis of Standard German conjugation.\n\n== Cases ==\nAs is extant in Standard German, the Nominative, Accusative, and Dative are present in Hunsrückisch. The genitive case, as often comes to be in German dialects, is not used and is replaced with the dative. Thus dessen Bruder becomes dämm seine Brorer.\n\n== Plural Formation ==\nIn all cases except one, plural formation is identical to that of Standard German. The only exception occurs when the Standard German plural form is -en, in which case the plural in Hunsrückisch is -e.\n\n== Regionalisms ==\nA number of words occur in Hunsrückisch which are either not found in Standard German, or occur rarely/in different contexts in Standard German.\n\n== Other influences ==\nBecause of its proximity to France, the Hunsrückisch dialect spoken in the Hunsrück region has experienced unique influences from the neighbouring French through the centuries. During Napoleonic times, the Hunsrück region was briefly incorporated into France.", "page_title": "Hunsrückisch", "word_tertile": "medium", "trgt": "Hunsrückisch is a German dialect spoken in the Hunsrück region of Germany (Rhineland-Palatinate).

Article:\n\n\"\"\"== Germany ==\nWhilst the Hunsrück region of Germany is well-defined, the distribution of Hunsrückisch itself is less so. On the one hand, the dialect extends beyond the Hunsrück area, but there are clear linguistic differences between the Hunsrückisch spoken in one locality and in another, and no uniform form of the dialect exists. That is made more difficult by the lack of written resources for the dialect. Since the 1990s, there has been an ongoing attempt to more scientifically document local dialects in the Mittelrheinischer Sprachatlas. The Rheinisches Wörterbuch entries of 1928-1971 have also been fully digitalised since then by the University of Trier.\n\nAs with almost all German dialects, the Hunsrückische dialect can be subdivided into many small local dialects, which each village having its own strand. The small-scale divisions of this linguistic area stem from how kingdoms in the Hunsrück area were often divided with borders that even cut through villages. The religious divisions in the predominantly protestant or catholic areas also contributed towards this linguistic separation.\n\nA considerable and accelerated reversal of the active use of the Hunsrückisch dialect has also been noted. Younger generations sometimes no longer speak dialect and rarely understand unique words pertinent to that dialect. Societies dedicated to preserving local culture and history, as well as individuals themselves, have been trying to stem this trend via modern communication and documentation methods.\n\n== Brazil ==\nThere is a variation of the dialect in southern Brazil and in the southeastern state of Espírito Santo (municipalities of Marechal Floriano, Domingos Martins and Santa Leopoldina), named Hunsrik German.\n\nThroughout its almost 200-year history in Southern Brazil and Espírito Santo, Hunsrückisch has been greatly influenced by other German dialects such as East Pomeranian, Swabian, and Austro-Bavarian; by other immigrant languages; and by Portuguese. Through Brazilian Portuguese, it has also incorporated Amerindian terminology, notably for fauna, flora and toponyms.\n\nBrazilian Hunsrik is spoken in the states of Rio Grande do Sul, the nearby state of Santa Catarina, in other parts of southern Brazil like Paraná, and in the Southeast region such as Espírito Santo and São Paulo. It's the second most spoken language in Brazil, after Portuguese.\n\n== Phonology ==\nHunsrückisch can roughly be classed under two dialect sub-groups. The first of these is the Rhenish Franconian languages, for Hunsrückisch spoken from the Nahe (Rhine) until approximately just beyond Kastellaun. The second of these groups is Moselle Franconian, for Hunsrückisch spoken between Kastellaun and Moselle. The main linguistic characteristic which separates these two groups of Hunsrückisch is the dat/das divide. In the North, such as in Idar-Oberstein, Gemünden, Kirchberg, and Boppard, the definite article is pronounced dat.

She has an especially close bond with her father. Sameera has on ongoing love story with Salman (Mikaal Zulfiqar) and her older brother Hamza is engaged to Salmans younger sister Warda. Salman's mother detests Sameerahs family, with her daughter already engaged to Hamza, she doesn't wish for Salman to also be connected to that family & so she tries to push her son away from Sameera. She introduces Salman to Pinky, the girl she believes is the girl for him. Sameera's ego is hurt by Salman's mother's harsh taunts towards her family & decides to end their relationship. An angry Salman forces his mother to apologise to Sameera and accept her as a daughter in law. Eventually, his mother gives in and soon after Warda's marriage to Hamza, Sameera completes her Nikkah to Salman. Not long after the wedding, Sameera goes for a meal with Hamza, her father & Warda. While leaving the restaurant Hamza goes back as he realises he has left his wallet. A few boys nearby in a car are discussing their anger at being rejected from girls & decide to teach the next girl they see a lesson. They watch as Sameera is waiting outside with her father and Warda. They drive up to them, jump out the car, one of them waving a gun while another grabs Warda. A struggle between both parties ensues as both Sameera and Warda are being grabbed by 2 boys and the father is in the middle holding on to both of them. Sameera's father loosens his grip on Sameera & shields Warda with his body. Sameera is dragged into the car. She kicks the door open as it's about to close and holds her hand out for her father to grab but he simply stares at her with tears in his eyes holding Warda. Sameera stares in disbelief before the door shuts and the car drives off. Hamza returns but is to late to save Sameera.\n\nSameera's mother questions the 3 of them about Sameera's whereabouts when they return home. Warda informs the mother that Sameera was kidnapped. Sameera's mother begins to shout and cry, she tells her husband and Hamza to report it to the police and find Sameera as soon as possible. Hamza and his father arrive at the police station to file a missing complaint but Sameera father freaks out and refuses to file a complaint. Once they arrive home Hamza informs his mother that their father refused to file a complaint. An argument breaks out between both parents as the father reveals he feels ashamed filing a complaint, he doesn't want his daughter's face all over the media and the whole world to know whats happened to her. He says to the mother we should just leave our faith in God and wait for the night to end, Sameera's mother is disgusted by her husband's words. Salmans parents arrive to comfort Sameerahs family. Salman's mother tells Warda privately that she thinks its best if Sameerah dies as Sameera has lost all her respect. Warda is shocked at the harshness of her mother's words & scolds her for being so insensitive. Salman returns from his job as a pilot and is informed by a crying Warda that Sameera is missing, he walks off to his room in anger. The next morning we see Sameera waking up in a field with her clothes ripped as strangers surround her. A woman stood nearby recognises Sameera, she quickly covers Sameera's body with a scarf and brings her home. Sameera younger sister Rohina is stood in the living room with Hamza and her mother when the woman enters with a half conscious Sameera. The next few days are difficult for Sameera as she struggles to recover from the trauma she has faced. Salman's parents & Warda come to visit Sameera but Salman refuses to see her. Both families gather in Sameerahs room. Warda asks Sameera how are you feeling prompting Sameera to lash out and reveal that her father chose to protect Warda instead of her. She accuses her father of presenting her to the rapists, she tells Hamza the rapists didn't take me, my father handed me to them. Sameera's father begins to cry and defend his actions, he claims he had no choice but to save Warda as she is his daughter in law and his best friends daughter. He asks Sameera can't you forgive your father to which Sameera replies fathers are not like this, the Sameera you knew is dead. The scene ends with the father walking out the room in tears.\n\nAfter a few days Salman finally visits Sameera. He makes it clear he doesn't want to know details on what happened to her and wishes to move forward from this incident. With her entire family against her, including Salman, Sameera is forced to stay silent and not file a police complaint. Her boss doctor Feroz is disappointed by this decision, and reminds her she is a survivor, not a victim. Eventually, Sameera & Warda move out their maternal homes and into their in-law homes. Sameera struggles with intimacy & suffers from nightmares. Salman feels irritated by this as it's a reminder of Sameera's rape, something which he wishes to pretend never happened. Salman forces Sameera to leave her job. Doctor Feroz refuses to accept her resignation shocked at how timid & quiet she has become. Salman disdain towards Sameera doesn't end there, he starts to insult and belittle Sameera & resorts to physical violence when she argues back. Salmans parents are aware of this but do little to defend Sameera. On one particular day after experiencing a brutal beating from Salman, Sameera is unable to leave her bed. Sameera's mother & Rohina come to visit her and are shocked to find her in such a bad state and rush her to the hospital. Doctor Feroz treats Sameera and informs her mother she must stay in hospital for a few days. When Doctor Feroz leaves Sameerahs mother decides Sameera will not stay in hospital. Sameera's mother drops her back off at her in law home despite Sameera crying and begging her mother to take her home. Hamza is unaware of Sameera's state and is enjoying married life to its fullest with Warda who is now pregnant. The stress at home & slipping grades takes its toll on Rohina as she attempts suicide but is found in time by her parents. After recovering Sameera comes home to spend a few nights with Rohina. She gets a call that Salman's car is being towed. Sameera is confused as Salman is away for work and his car should be at the airport. Hamza and Sameera rush to identify the car where they see Salman walking out of the hotel with his hand around Pinkie. Sameera screams at Salman before leaving with Hamza. Later Salman, under threat from his father, comes to make amends with Sameera, but she makes it clear their relationship is over. Warda defends her brother's actions causing arguments between her and Hamza.\n\nDespite protests from her parents Sameera decides to start working again & files a police complaint with Hamza supporting her. Doctor Feroz is proud of Sameera and realises he is starting to fall in love with her. Salman marries Pinky and Warda secretly sneaks out the house to attend. Rohina sees photos on Warda's phone of her at the wedding and exposes her in front of the whole family leaving Hamza and the parents furious, Sameera however is least bothered.

Later in 1943, the Gruppe was transferred to Austria to combat the incursions from the Italian-based United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) 15th Air Force.\n\nAfter heavy losses in July 1944, II./ZG 1 converted to the Messerschmitt Bf 109 G fighter and were redesignated as III./Jagdgeschwader 76. Albrecht-Lemke then led the unit in operations over the Invasion front in western France.\n\nOn 25 August 1944 Albrecht was intercepted by USAAF P-51 Mustang fighters and shot down in his Bf 109 G-14 near Creil. Albrecht-Lemke bailed out of his stricken aircraft but was dead when found on the ground.\n\nAlbrecht-Lemke was credited with 25 victories, with 15 victories claimed over the Eastern Front and 10 over the Western Front. This total included at least six B-24 four-engine USAAF bombers. In addition he claimed 11 aircraft destroyed on the ground on the Eastern Front.\n\n== Aerial victory claims ==\nMathews and Foreman, authors of Luftwaffe Aces — Biographies and Victory Claims, researched the German Federal Archives and found records for more than 18 aerial victory claims. This figure includes at least eleven aerial victories on the Eastern Front and seven four-engined bombers on the Western Front.\"\"\""}

The soluble and transmembrane forms of the protein are formed by alternative splicing of the same RNA transcript,\n\nThe soluble form of SCF contains a proteolytic cleavage site in exon 6. Cleavage at this site allows the extracellular portion of the protein to be released. The transmembrane form of SCF is formed by alternative splicing that excludes exon 6 (Figure 1). Both forms of SCF bind to c-KIT and are biologically active.\n\nSoluble and transmembrane SCF is produced by fibroblasts and endothelial cells. Soluble SCF has a molecular weight of 18,5 KDa and forms a dimer. It is detected in normal human blood serum at 3.3 ng/mL.\n\n== Role in development ==\nSCF plays an important role in the hematopoiesis during embryonic development. Sites where hematopoiesis takes place, such as the fetal liver and bone marrow, all express SCF. Mice that do not express SCF die in utero from severe anemia. Mice that do not express the receptor for SCF (c-KIT) also die from anemia. SCF may serve as guidance cues that direct hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to their stem cell niche (the microenvironment in which a stem cell resides), and it plays an important role in HSC maintenance. Non-lethal point mutants on the c-KIT receptor can cause anemia, decreased fertility, and decreased pigmentation.\n\nDuring development, the presence of the SCF also plays an important role in the localization of melanocytes, cells that produce melanin and control pigmentation. In melanogenesis, melanoblasts migrate from the neural crest to their appropriate locations in the epidermis. Melanoblasts express the KIT receptor, and it is believed that SCF guides these cells to their terminal locations. SCF also regulates survival and proliferation of fully differentiated melanocytes in adults.\n\nIn spermatogenesis, c-KIT is expressed in primordial germ cells, spermatogonia, and in primordial oocytes. It is also expressed in the primordial germ cells of females. SCF is expressed along the pathways that the germ cells use to reach their terminal destination in the body. It is also expressed in the final destinations for these cells. Like for melanoblasts, this helps guide the cells to their appropriate locations in the body.\n\n== Role in hematopoiesis ==\nSCF plays a role in the regulation of HSCs in the stem cell niche in the bone marrow. SCF has been shown to increase the survival of HSCs in vitro and contributes to the self-renewal and maintenance of HSCs in-vivo. HSCs at all stages of development express the same levels of the receptor for SCF (c-KIT). The stromal cells that surround HSCs are a component of the stem cell niche, and they release a number of ligands, including SCF.\n\nIn the bone marrow, HSCs and hematopoietic progenitor cells are adjacent to stromal cells, such as fibroblasts and osteoblasts (Figure 2). These HSCs remain in the niche by adhering to ECM proteins and to the stromal cells themselves. SCF has been shown to increase adhesion and thus may play a large role in ensuring that HSCs remain in the niche.\n\nA small percentage of HSCs regularly leave the bone marrow to enter circulation and then return to their niche in the bone marrow. It is believed that concentration gradients of SCF, along with the chemokine SDF-1, allow HSCs to find their way back to the niche.\n\nIn adult mice, the injection of the ACK2 anti-KIT antibody, which binds to the c-Kit receptor and inactivates it, leads to severe problems in hematopoiesis. It causes a significant decrease in the number HSC and other hematopoietic progenitor cells in the bone marrow. This suggests that SCF and c-Kit plays an important role in hematopoietic function in adulthood. SCF also increases the survival of various hematopoietic progenitor cells, such as megakaryocyte progenitors, in vitro. In addition, it works with other cytokines to support the colony growth of BFU-E, CFU-GM, and CFU-GEMM4. Hematopoietic progenitor cells have also been shown to migrate towards a higher concentration gradient of SCF in vitro, which suggests that SCF is involved in chemotaxis for these cells.\n\nFetal HSCs are more sensitive to SCF than HSCs from adults. In fact, fetal HSCs in cell culture are 6 times more sensitive to SCF than adult HSCs based on the concentration that allows maximum survival.\n\n== Expression in mast cells ==\nMast cells are the only terminally differentiated hematopoietic cells that express the c-Kit receptor. Mice with SCF or c-Kit mutations have severe defects in the production of mast cells, having less than 1% of the normal levels of mast cells. Conversely, the injection of SCF increases mast cell numbers near the site of injection by over 100 times. In addition, SCF promotes mast cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, and survival. It also promotes the release of histamine and tryptase, which are involved in the allergic response.\n\n== Soluble and transmembrane forms ==\nThe presence of both soluble and transmembrane SCF is required for normal hematopoietic function. Mice that produce the soluble SCF but not transmembrane SCF suffer from anemia, are sterile, and lack pigmentation. This suggests that transmembrane SCF plays a special role in vivo that is separate from that of soluble SCF.\n\n== c-KIT receptor ==\nSCF binds to the c-KIT receptor (CD 117), a receptor tyrosine kinase. c-Kit is expressed in HSCs, mast cells, melanocytes, and germ cells. It is also expressed in hematopoietic progenitor cells including erythroblasts, myeloblasts, and megakaryocytes. However, with the exception of mast cells, expression decreases as these hematopoietic cells mature and c-KIT is not present when these cells are fully differentiated (Figure 3). SCF binding to c-KIT causes the receptor to homodimerize and auto-phosphorylate at tyrosine residues. The activation of c-Kit leads to the activation of multiple signaling cascades, including the RAS/ERK, PI3-Kinase, Src kinase, and JAK/STAT pathways.\n\n== Clinical relevance ==\nSCF may be used along with other cytokines to culture HSCs and hematopoietic progenitors. The expansion of these cells ex-vivo (outside the body) would allow advances in bone marrow transplantation, in which HSCs are transferred to a patient to re-establish blood formation. One of the problems of injecting SCF for therapeutic purposes is that SCF activates mast cells. The injection of SCF has been shown to cause allergic-like symptoms and the proliferation of mast cells and melanocytes.\n\nCardiomyocyte-specific overexpression of transmembrane SCF promotes stem cell migration and improves cardiac function and animal survival after myocardial infarction.\n\n== Interactions ==\nStem cell factor has been shown to interact with CD117.", "src": "== Production ==\nThe gene encoding stem cell factor (SCF) is found on the Sl locus in mice and on chromosome 12q22-12q24 in humans.

One of the problems of injecting SCF for therapeutic purposes is that SCF activates mast cells. The injection of SCF has been shown to cause allergic-like symptoms and the proliferation of mast cells and melanocytes.\n\nCardiomyocyte-specific overexpression of transmembrane SCF promotes stem cell migration and improves cardiac function and animal survival after myocardial infarction.\n\n== Interactions ==\nStem cell factor has been shown to interact with CD117.\"\"\""}

It opened in 1837, connecting Tallahassee, Florida to the Gulf of Mexico port of St. Marks, Florida. This was the second steam railroad in Florida, opening just a year after the Lake Wimico and St. Joseph Canal and Railroad.\n\nThe Florida, Atlantic and Gulf Central Railroad was chartered January 24, 1851, to build west from Jacksonville, Florida, and construction began in 1857. The Pensacola and Georgia Railroad was chartered in January 1853, to be built east from Pensacola, Florida, but started at Tallahassee. The two lines met at Lake City, Florida in 1860, and the latter also built from Tallahassee west to four miles (6 km) short of Quincy, Florida, stopping in 1863 in the middle of the American Civil War.\n\nIn 1855 the Pensacola and Georgia bought the Tallahassee. In 1869 the two merged to form the Jacksonville, Pensacola and Mobile Railroad, which obtained trackage rights over the Florida Central Railroad, the 1868 reorganization of the Florida, Atlantic and Gulf. The railroad eventually was built west to Chattahoochee, Florida, a major junction with the Pensacola and Atlantic Railroad continuing west and the Chattahoochee and East Pass Railroad running northeast. In 1882, Sir Edward Reed purchased the Jacksonville, Pensacola and Mobile, absorbing the Florida Central and reorganizing the two as the Florida Central and Western Railroad.\n\nThe Florida Railroad was incorporated January 8, 1853, to build a line across the state, from Fernandina, Florida (north of Jacksonville, Florida) southwest to Cedar Key, Florida. The first train ran in 1861, but the line failed and the company was reorganized in 1866. In 1872 it was reorganized again as the Atlantic, Gulf and West India Transit Company. In 1881, Sir Edward Reed purchased the railroad and reorganized it as the Florida Transit Company, which in 1883 was reorganized again as the Florida Transit and Peninsular Railroad. The Florida Transit and Peninsular operated two subsidiaries, the Peninsula Railroad and Tropical Florida Railroad, organized to build lines respectively from the Florida Transit at Waldo, Florida to Ocala, Florida and beyond to Tampa, Florida.\n\nIn 1884-85, Reed merged the Florida Transit and Peninsular Railroad with the Florida Central and Western Railroad, Fernandina and Jacksonville Railroad, and Leesburg and Indian River Railroad as the Florida Railway and Navigation Company, which instantly became the largest railroad system in Florida. The new company was placed in receivership in October 1885, sold at foreclosure and reorganized as the Florida Central and Peninsular Railroad Company in 1886.\n\nOn May 1, 1889, the company was reorganized again, as the Florida Central and Peninsular Railway, and on January 16, 1893, the final reorganization produced the Florida Central and Peninsular Railroad, along with a merger of the Florida Northern Railroad (a line from Yulee to Savannah, Georgia). The Seaboard Air Line Railway leased the FC&P on July 1, 1900, and the latter was merged into the former on August 15, 1903. The FC&P tracks from Savannah, Georgia to Tampa, Florida via Jacksonville would become part of Seaboard's main line.\n\nThough various mergers, the Seaboard Air Line would become part of CSX Transportation. Much of the former FC&P network remains in service today.\n\n== Main Lines (Southern and Western Divisions) ==\nBy the time the Florida Central and Peninsular Railroad reached its greatest extent in 1893, it essentially had two main lines. One of the main lines (the Western Division) extended from Jacksonville west to Tallahassee and Chattahoochee, where it connected to the Pensacola and Atlantic Railroad (a subsidiary of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad). The other main line (the Southern Division) was what was previously the Florida Railroad extending from Fernandina Beach to Cedar Key. These two main lines intersected at Baldwin Junction just west of Jacksonville. The routes would continue operation after Seaboard acquired the lines in 1900, though Seaboard designated the route to Tampa as the main line south of Waldo instead of the route to Cedar Key.\n\nSeaboard abandoned the former Southern Division from Archer to Cedar Key in 1932. The line was abandoned between Callahan and Yulee in 1954. The line from Archer to Waldo would be removed in the late 1980s. Today, State Road 24 runs along much of the former right of way of the route between Waldo and Cedar Key. The Waldo Road Greenway also runs along the former right of way between Gainesville and Waldo. South of Baldwin, it is part of CSX's S Line.\n\nFC&P's Southern Division is still active and in service as the following:\n\nThe Western Division remains operates as the following routes:\n\n== Tampa Division ==\nThe Tampa Division ran from the Fernandina-Cedar Key line at Waldo south to Tampa. This had been chartered as the Peninsula Railroad north of Ocala and the Tropical Florida Railroad south of Ocala.

The branch remains in service as part of CSX's Brooker Subdivision from Starke to a point just west of LaCrosse. The branch's connection with the main line is still known as Wannee Junction.\n\nThe branch to Early Bird was built in 1890 and branched off the Southern Division in Archer. The line gained more prominence in the Seaboard era. Seaboard extended the branch south through Dunnellon and Hernando to Inverness in 1911.

It was one of the first operating railroads in Florida. It's become the longest-operating railroad in Florida at 147 years. It was abandoned in 1983. The Florida Park Service currently maintains it as the Tallahassee-St. Marks Historic Railroad State Trail.", "src": "== History ==\nThe Tallahassee Rail Road was first organized in 1832 as the Leon Railway, changing its name in 1834. It opened in 1837, connecting Tallahassee, Florida to the Gulf of Mexico port of St. Marks, Florida. This was the second steam railroad in Florida, opening just a year after the Lake Wimico and St. Joseph Canal and Railroad.\n\nThe Florida, Atlantic and Gulf Central Railroad was chartered January 24, 1851, to build west from Jacksonville, Florida, and construction began in 1857. The Pensacola and Georgia Railroad was chartered in January 1853, to be built east from Pensacola, Florida, but started at Tallahassee. The two lines met at Lake City, Florida in 1860, and the latter also built from Tallahassee west to four miles (6 km) short of Quincy, Florida, stopping in 1863 in the middle of the American Civil War.\n\nIn 1855 the Pensacola and Georgia bought the Tallahassee. In 1869 the two merged to form the Jacksonville, Pensacola and Mobile Railroad, which obtained trackage rights over the Florida Central Railroad, the 1868 reorganization of the Florida, Atlantic and Gulf. The railroad eventually was built west to Chattahoochee, Florida, a major junction with the Pensacola and Atlantic Railroad continuing west and the Chattahoochee and East Pass Railroad running northeast. In 1882, Sir Edward Reed purchased the Jacksonville, Pensacola and Mobile, absorbing the Florida Central and reorganizing the two as the Florida Central and Western Railroad.\n\nThe Florida Railroad was incorporated January 8, 1853, to build a line across the state, from Fernandina, Florida (north of Jacksonville, Florida) southwest to Cedar Key, Florida. The first train ran in 1861, but the line failed and the company was reorganized in 1866. In 1872 it was reorganized again as the Atlantic, Gulf and West India Transit Company. In 1881, Sir Edward Reed purchased the railroad and reorganized it as the Florida Transit Company, which in 1883 was reorganized again as the Florida Transit and Peninsular Railroad. The Florida Transit and Peninsular operated two subsidiaries, the Peninsula Railroad and Tropical Florida Railroad, organized to build lines respectively from the Florida Transit at Waldo, Florida to Ocala, Florida and beyond to Tampa, Florida.\n\nIn 1884-85, Reed merged the Florida Transit and Peninsular Railroad with the Florida Central and Western Railroad, Fernandina and Jacksonville Railroad, and Leesburg and Indian River Railroad as the Florida Railway and Navigation Company, which instantly became the largest railroad system in Florida. The new company was placed in receivership in October 1885, sold at foreclosure and reorganized as the Florida Central and Peninsular Railroad Company in 1886.\n\nOn May 1, 1889, the company was reorganized again, as the Florida Central and Peninsular Railway, and on January 16, 1893, the final reorganization produced the Florida Central and Peninsular Railroad, along with a merger of the Florida Northern Railroad (a line from Yulee to Savannah, Georgia). The Seaboard Air Line Railway leased the FC&P on July 1, 1900, and the latter was merged into the former on August 15, 1903. The FC&P tracks from Savannah, Georgia to Tampa, Florida via Jacksonville would become part of Seaboard's main line.\n\nThough various mergers, the Seaboard Air Line would become part of CSX Transportation. Much of the former FC&P network remains in service today.\n\n== Main Lines (Southern and Western Divisions) ==\nBy the time the Florida Central and Peninsular Railroad reached its greatest extent in 1893, it essentially had two main lines. One of the main lines (the Western Division) extended from Jacksonville west to Tallahassee and Chattahoochee, where it connected to the Pensacola and Atlantic Railroad (a subsidiary of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad). The other main line (the Southern Division) was what was previously the Florida Railroad extending from Fernandina Beach to Cedar Key. These two main lines intersected at Baldwin Junction just west of Jacksonville. The routes would continue operation after Seaboard acquired the lines in 1900, though Seaboard designated the route to Tampa as the main line south of Waldo instead of the route to Cedar Key.\n\nSeaboard abandoned the former Southern Division from Archer to Cedar Key in 1932. The line was abandoned between Callahan and Yulee in 1954. The line from Archer to Waldo would be removed in the late 1980s. Today, State Road 24 runs along much of the former right of way of the route between Waldo and Cedar Key. The Waldo Road Greenway also runs along the former right of way between Gainesville and Waldo. South of Baldwin, it is part of CSX's S Line.\n\nFC&P's Southern Division is still active and in service as the following:\n\nThe Western Division remains operates as the following routes:\n\n== Tampa Division ==\nThe Tampa Division ran from the Fernandina-Cedar Key line at Waldo south to Tampa.

Having that, Leczna can be considered a central Jewish location in the Polish territories during the second half of the second millennium.\n\nLike other Polish Jews, the Jews living in Leczna were mostly craftsmen such as shoemakers, tailors and butchers. In 1674, the Jews constituted 33% of the 547 individuals living in town. Shortly after the Jewish community had gotten a permit to establish their own synagogue, which still stands on the same place as in the 17th century. The Jewish community of Leczna enjoyed a relatively free and unrestricted everyday life, unlike other towns in eastern Europe and Poland specifically. Although some restrictions were imposed on the production of liquor (Herszek Kodenski, for example, was allowed to produce 400 cauldrons of Vodka, having to pay an annual fee of 400 zloti), owning of pubs, distilleries and other alcoholic facilities was allowed, unlike in other places, and the Jews had rights of to vote for every forth mayor who came from a Christian family. The decision to tax vodka in 1777 made the Jews earn a bigger income, and eventually gained the community the ability to raise a community trust.\n\n== 19th century ==\nBy 1803, 38% of the town 1,465 inhabitants were Jews (563 individuals), but by 1840 - this percentage had doubled itself reaching 64% of the total population (1,754 Jews among 2,715 citizens). In 1846 the Jewish quarter was almost entirely burnt down, as happened also to the synagogue. During that time, the town was one of the most central centers of Hasidic Judaism in Poland, and known in Hebrew and Yiddish as \"Hassidut Lanteshna\" (\"חסידות לנטשנה\"), founded in town by Rabbi Isaac, a student of the famous Yaakov Yitzchak of Lublin. Disputes over the election of a main community Rabbi had erupted regularly during the 19th century, between the Hasidic and Orthodox Jews living in town.\n\nDuring the 1864 Polish January Uprising against the Russian Empire, one of the captured rebels was lieutenant Rachman Borenstejn, a Jewish resident of Leczna, who was eventually killed.\n\n== 20th century ==\nThe Jewish community numbered 2,019 (63% of the total population in 1921). 1,617 Jews lived in Liczna in 1922. The community owned a synagogue, a mikveh, a prayer-house, a pre-burial house and a cemetery. In 1936, eight people were chosen to the general municipal council, showing just how dominant was the Jewish community in town. While 1889 Poles were living in town in 1935, the Jewish community reached to a number peak of 2273.\n\nWith the Nazi occupation, Poles and Jews were forced under a curfew. Jews were also forced to wear a yellow star on their chests and later on their arms. Jews were no longer admitted to Caffe's, hotels and bars. As a results of the Nazi regulation forced upon Polish Jews by Reinhard Heydrich, a Jewish Ghetto was established in Liczna and all Jews were forced to move into its borders. After the Ghetto was established, the supervision was given to Ukrainians who were trained by the Nazi's in Trawniki concentration camp. Nevertheless, a segregation fence between the Jewish and Polish communities wes built not before 1942. In January 1940, a local Judenrat was established by the Nazi's, consisting of 12 members. Icek Chaim Fruchtman was the head of the Judenrat. A Jewish local mutual help committee was established in July 1940. Icek Zylberstein, A local, was the chairman of the committee. A health service was founded in 1940 and a public kitchen in 1941.\n\nBetween Meach and July 1942, Jews from Czechoslovakia and Bohemia arrived to the Liczna Ghetto. The population of the Ghetto grew from 2,191 in March 1941 to 3000 in October 1942.\n\nThe first transport to the Sobibor extermination camp was on October 25, 1942. About 3,000 people, mostly elderly and kids, were sent away. In September 1943 the Germans killed 23 Jews at Kanałowa Street and 50 Jews at Łańcuchowa Street. 970 Jews were killed by the Nazis during Yom Kippur holiday in 1943. Wojciech Wieczorek, the author of \"Szkice z prowincji\" [\"Memories from the province\"], describes the event: \"Next to the synagogue there was quite a large square, with a ravine on its one side. The ravine was grooved a long time ago by rains and thawing snow. The ravine went down to the Lublin road, near the Świnka River Valley. It was the place where Jews in the rows of four each were walked from the ghetto. Afterwards, a machine gun did its job. Jews were killed not only in groups but also individually. It was done during the later phase of the murders, while searching for those who hid in the recesses in the ghetto. Moreover, the wounded who tried to hide were also hit by death blows. For the sake of certainty, the Germans threw hand grenades into the pit where dead bodies lay. Then, Jewish policemen were ordered to cover the bodies with a layer of ground.\" During the Holocaust, about 2,500 Jews who lived in Leczna prior to the war, were killed by the Nazis.

After a new synagogue was built nearby, the building became a museum for the town history, including Judaica and Jewish-related artifacts. In September 1961, a plaque was put on the outer wall of the building commemorating its former use and the annihilated Jewish community that used to live there. On July 4, 2014, the synagogue was sprayed in graffiti containing anti-Jewish remarks.

For the Pleistocene in Central and Eastern Europe and also in parts of NorthWestern Europe, Pupilla loessica constitutes a significant glacial index species.\n\nIndividual specimens had been found since the early Pleistocene. It was widespread above all in the middle Pleistocene and late Pleistocene.\n\nFossil distribution of Pupilla loessica include:\n\nAt an early date (1986), Ložek supported the view that Pupilla loessica was alive at the present time in Central Asia.\n\nRecent distribution of Pupilla loessica include:\n\n== Description ==\nThe shells of Pupilla loessica are about 3 mm high, thin, cylindrical-ovate and have a rounded conical apex. The approximately 5 strongly curved whorls gradually increase in height and are finely and irregularly ribbed. The short elliptical aperture has no denticles, no palatal callus and is only slightly broadened. The crest is at most indicated by a weak band.\n\nThe shells are usually a strong brown colour when fresh. The fine ribs evidence very low, fragile rims which are not always visible in recent shells. On weathered shells the fine ribs are still visible although less pronounced, as on the shells of the Pleistocene Pupilla loessica.\n\nThe width of the recent shells is 1.6-1.8 mm. The height of the shells of the recent shell is 2.5-3.3 mm.\n\nThe species differs from Pupilla muscorum by its smaller size, the strongly rounded and ribbed whorls and the lack of denticles and crest. The species is similar to Pupilla alpicola with similar intraspecific shell shape differences across time suggesting that similar niche shifts have led to similar transformations in parallel.\n\n== Ecology ==\nPupilla loessica occur from woodland to dry steppe. The altitude ranges from 560 m a.s.l. to high altitude habitats around 3000 m a.s.l. This species prefer continental types of habitat with average annual temperatures markedly below 0 °C. The climate ranges from continental to sub-boreal climate. Although it is a frequent loess mollusc, it apparently lived in various glacial habitats.\n\nPupilla loessica is found in various different habitats in the Saylyugem Mountains. These habitats range from stony steppe via open woodland with Larix sibirica, shrubland, mesophilic meadows to humid high altitude meadows with Carex sp. and Dryas oxyodonta (alpine tundra).\n\nFor example in Saylyugem Mountains Pupilla loessica lives in 2200–2650 m a.s.l. The closest known meteorological station is the Kosh Agach Station: the average annual temperature recorded amounts to –6.7 °C (January –32 °C, July 13 °C) and the annual rainfall amounts to about 110–150 mm on average.\n\nThis species often accompanies the so-called Pupilla fauna and Columella fauna (according to Ložek 1964). In addition to Pupilla spp., species which like humidity, such as Columella columella or Vertigo genesii, are also often found together with Pupilla loessica. The corresponding accompanying fauna is also adapted to the cold habitats, including e.g. Columella columella, Vertigo genesii, Vallonia tenuilabris, etc. Such malacofauna in recent habitats (especially on the humid alpine meadows) correspond to those of the Pleistocene glacial habitats of the Central European region.", "src": "== Distribution ==\nPupilla loessica was first described by Czech biologist Vojen Ložek in 1954 from late Pleistocene loess from Předmostí u Přerova (Moravia, Czech Republic).

For the Pleistocene in Central and Eastern Europe and also in parts of NorthWestern Europe, Pupilla loessica constitutes a significant glacial index species.\n\nIndividual specimens had been found since the early Pleistocene. It was widespread above all in the middle Pleistocene and late Pleistocene.\n\nFossil distribution of Pupilla loessica include:\n\nAt an early date (1986), Ložek supported the view that Pupilla loessica was alive at the present time in Central Asia.\n\nRecent distribution of Pupilla loessica include:\n\n== Description ==\nThe shells of Pupilla loessica are about 3 mm high, thin, cylindrical-ovate and have a rounded conical apex. The approximately 5 strongly curved whorls gradually increase in height and are finely and irregularly ribbed. The short elliptical aperture has no denticles, no palatal callus and is only slightly broadened. The crest is at most indicated by a weak band.\n\nThe shells are usually a strong brown colour when fresh. The fine ribs evidence very low, fragile rims which are not always visible in recent shells. On weathered shells the fine ribs are still visible although less pronounced, as on the shells of the Pleistocene Pupilla loessica.\n\nThe width of the recent shells is 1.6-1.8 mm. The height of the shells of the recent shell is 2.5-3.3 mm.\n\nThe species differs from Pupilla muscorum by its smaller size, the strongly rounded and ribbed whorls and the lack of denticles and crest. The species is similar to Pupilla alpicola with similar intraspecific shell shape differences across time suggesting that similar niche shifts have led to similar transformations in parallel.\n\n== Ecology ==\nPupilla loessica occur from woodland to dry steppe. The altitude ranges from 560 m a.s.l. to high altitude habitats around 3000 m a.s.l. This species prefer continental types of habitat with average annual temperatures markedly below 0 °C.

He later became a judge in a military court, where he served for a short amount of time.\n\nFor a time, Chang was appointed the chief of the Fengtian military police. In 1927, he started working with the Communications Clique as the Minister of Communications for the Beiyang government under the Fengtian clique, which meant that he had considerable power over media. Sometime during the same year, he played a major role in the construction of the Dahushan-Tongliao Railway. During the Northern Expedition, he was charged with the transport of ammunition down the Beijing-Mukden Railway. In 1928, Chang was appointed governor of Heilongjiang by Zhang Xueliang, who had recently taken over the Fengtian clique and its attached National Pacification Army.\n\nUpon becoming governor of Heilongjiang, Chang's hatred for Zhang Xueliang became more apparent. He refused to lend money to Zhang, and even started building up his own army. On 10 January 1929, Chang and Yang went to Zhang to demand that Chang be appointed Northeast Railway Supervisor, a new role they wanted to create so they could take over the China Eastern Railway. When they left, Zhang ordered the two men's execution. Zhang himself claimed that this action was due to a conspiracy by Chang and Yang to rebel against the Fengtian clique, while Zhang's secretary traced it back to the poor attitudes Yang and Chang held toward Zhang, their superior.\"\"\""}

The following year the manufacturer folded, and founder Piero Dusio flew to Argentina. Abarth, funded by Armando Scagliarini, took over Cisitalia's assets and on 31 March 1949 Abarth & C. was founded in Bologna. Carlo's astrological sign, Scorpio, was chosen as the company logo. From the Cisitalia liquidation Abarth obtained five 204 sports cars (two complete Spiders and three unfinished), a D46 single seater and various spares. The 204s were immediately rechristened Abarth 204 A. Abarth built and raced sports cars developed from the last Cisitalia cars. In addition to Guido Scagliarini, the \"Squadra Abarth\" racing team lined up celebrated drivers including Tazio Nuvolari, Franco Cortese and Piero Taruffi. Notably Tazio Nuvolari made his last appearance in racing at the wheel of an Abarth 204 A, winning its class in the Palermo–Monte Pellegrino hillclimb on 10 April 1950. Alongside racing, the company's main activity was producing and selling accessories and performance parts for Fiat, Lancia, Cisitalia and Simca cars, like inlet manifolds and silencers.\n\nOn 9 April 1951 the company's headquarters were moved to Turin; Abarth began his well-known association with Fiat in 1952, when it built the Abarth 1500 Biposto on Fiat mechanicals.\n\nIn the 1960s, Abarth was successful in hillclimbing and sports car racing, mainly in classes from 850 cc to 2000 cc, competing with Porsche 904 and Ferrari Dino. Hans Herrmann was a factory driver from 1962 until 1965, winning the 500 km Nürburgring in 1963 with Teddy Pilette.\n\nAbarth promised Johann Abt that he could race a factory car free if he won all the races he entered. Abt almost succeeded: of the 30 races he entered, Abt won 29 and finished second once. Abt later founded Abt Sportsline.\n\nAbarth produced high-performance exhaust pipes, diversifying into tuning kits for road vehicles, mainly for Fiat. A racing exhaust was produced for the 1950s Lambretta models \"D\" and \"LD\". Original Abarth LD exhausts are now valuable collectors' items. Reproductions are available which carry the Abarth name; how Fiat feels about this is not known. Lambretta even held several 125 cc motorcycle land speed records during the 1950s thanks partly to the exhaust that Abarth developed for them.\n\nAbarth also helped build sports or racing cars with Porsche and Simca.\n\n== 1971: Fiat takeover ==\nCarlo sold Abarth to Fiat on 31 July 1971. The acquisition was not made public until 15 October. As Fiat was not interested in the Reparto Corse racing operations, these were taken over by Enzo Osella. Osella obtained cars, spares, technicians and drivers (amongst them Arturo Merzario), and continued the racing activity founding the Osella racing team. Thus ended for Abarth the days of sport prototype and hill climb racing.\n\nUnder Fiat ownership, Abarth became the Fiat Group's racing department, managed by engine designer Aurelio Lampredi. Abarth prepared Fiat's rally cars, including the Fiat 124 Abarth Rally and 131 Abarth. In December 1977, in advance of the 1978 racing season, the beforehand competing Abarth and Squadra Corse Lancia factory racing operations were merged by Fiat into a single entity named EASA (Ente per l'Attività Sportiva Automobilistica, Organization for Car Sports Racing Activities). Cesare Fiorio (previously in charge of the Lancia rally team) was appointed director, while Daniele Audetto was sporting director; the EASA headquarters were set up in Abarth's Corso Marche (Turin) offices. The combined racing department developed the Lancia Beta Montecarlo Turbo Group 5 racing car which won the 1980 World Championship for Makes and the 1981 World Endurance Championship of Makes. It also created the Lancia Rally 037 Group B rally car which won for Lancia the 1983 World Manufacturers' Championship).\n\nOn 1 October 1981, Abarth & C. ceased to exist and was replaced by Fiat Auto Gestione Sportiva, a division of the parent company specialized in the management of racing programmes that would remain in operation through to the end of 1999, when it changed to Fiat Auto Corse S.p.A.\n\nSome commercial models built by Fiat or its subsidiaries Lancia and Autobianchi were co-branded Abarth, including the Autobianchi A112 Abarth, a lightweight and inexpensive \"boy racer\". A112 Abarth was introduced with a 58HP engine, soon followed by a 70HP one, and a specific \"A112 Abarth trophy\" was run from 1977 to 1984.\n\nIn the 1980s, Abarth name was mainly used to mark performance cars, such as the Fiat Ritmo Abarth 125/130 TC.\n\nIn 2000s, Fiat used the Abarth brand to designate a trim/model level, as in the Fiat Stilo Abarth.\n\n== 2007: Rebirth of Abarth & C.

To his surprise, Indu also boards the same bus in which Sriram is travelling. Indu has decided to run away from her home as she could not bear her father's torture. Now Karunakaran again misunderstands that Sriram and Indu have eloped together and chases them.\n\nSriram and Indu get down from the bus to safeguard their lives and run towards to a forest. They stay for a few days in the forest as they didn't know the way to get out from there. Finally, Sriram and Indu manage to return. In the meantime, Karunakaran has lodged a complaint that Indu was kidnapped by Sriram. The couple reaches the court and reveals that no one was kidnapped and they also make it clear that they are not in love and all the happenings are mere coincidence.\n\nFinally, Karunakaran realizes his mistake and understands the Sriram's good intention of only marrying a girl selected by his parents and also feels bad about his rude behaviour towards his daughter. He also expresses interest to get Indu married to Sriram as he will not be able to find a better match than him. The movie ends with both Indu and Sriram getting united.\n\n== Soundtrack ==\nSoundtrack was composed by Vidyasagar.\n\n== Release ==\nThe Hindu gave the film a below-average review, noting \"it is not that the director does not have a message for the viewer. He does, but the faulty approach to the theme takes the film far away from the mark.\" Thiraipadam wrote \"The one-line story is definitely difficult to translate to a two and a half hour movie. With the only things happening being a series of incidents where Bala and Sharmi are inadvertently caught together, P. Vasu's only option was to provide interesting characters and create an interesting scenario for the results of the suspicions on the couple. He unfortunately fails on both fronts\". Chennai Online wrote \"The knot had the potential, but with the director depending on a whole series of co-incidences to carry forward his story, there's not much surprise or exciting viewing for the audience\". The film fared below average at the box office.\"\"\""}

He had a twin sister, Mary (1552–1607; later Countess of Southampton), but their mother, Lady Jane, died in childbirth. Their grandfather was another Sir Anthony Browne (died 1548), knight of the shire for Surrey, and their great-grandfather, Sir Anthony Browne (died 1506) held the office of Standard Bearer of England. By 1558 their father, Lord Montagu, had married secondly Magdalen Dacre, by whom he had three further sons, George, Thomas and Henry, and three daughters, Elizabeth, Mabel and Jane.\n\nBrowne's relationship with his stepmother appears to have been close. She was said to have had \"so solicitous a care of his health as if he had been her own child\", and was so far from preferring her own children at Browne's expense that when an incident occurred which incurred Viscount Montagu's displeasure against his eldest son and heir, \"she pacified her husband\", and brought Browne into his father's favour again.\n\nIn 1572, Browne married Mary Dormer, a daughter of Sir William Dormer (died 1575) by his second wife, Dorothy Catesby. They had two sons, Anthony-Maria (born March 1574), who, shortly after his father's death in 1592, succeeded his grandfather as Viscount Montague, and John; and three daughters, Dorothy, who married Edmund Lee, Jane, who married Sir Francis Englefield, 1st Baronet (c. 1561 – c. 1631) and Katherine, who married John Tregonwell. In 1580, Browne was Sheriff of Surrey and of Kent, an office usually held for only one year.\n\nOn 19 February 1565/66, at the age of thirteen, Browne's twin sister, Mary, had married, from their father's house in London, Henry Wriothesley, 2nd Earl of Southampton. On 1 November 1573, a month after Mary had given birth to her son, Henry, the 2nd Earl wrote to Sir William More that he and his wife would stop at Loseley on their journey to London, which they were making in the company of \"my brother Anthony Browne and his wife\".\n\nHowever, this happy state of affairs did not long continue. Around 1577 the 2nd Earl, for reasons unknown, had forbidden Mary ever to see again a certain Donsame, \"a common person\". When, in, 1580 it was reported to him that she had been seen at Dogmersfield with Donsame, he forever banished her his 'board and presence', forcing her to live at one of his Hampshire estates under close surveillance. The Countess defended herself with spirit in a long letter to her father, Viscount Montague, on 21 March 1580, denying adultery and accusing one of the Earl's servants, Thomas Dymock, of having been the cause of the contention between herself and her husband. The two families and their servants were drawn into the trouble between Mary Browne and her husband. An entry in the register of the Privy Council records that one of the 2nd Earl of Southampton's servants had been committed to the Marshalsea on 23 February 1580 \"for certain misdemeanors by him used against Mr Anthony Brown, the eldest sonne of the Lord Montacute\".\n\nIn September 1588, a contemporary reported to Bernardino de Mendoza, then Spanish Ambassador in Paris, that Browne, his young son, and two of his half brothers, George and Henry, had accompanied Viscount Montagu to Tilbury, where the Viscount had been the first nobleman to appear there with his forces at the threat of invasion by the Spanish Armada:\n\nIt is unknown if Browne was present during the Queen's 6-day visit to Cowdray in August 1591 at which his half-brother, Henry, organised the Queen's sport at hunting, and his half-brother, George, and brother-in-law, Robert Dormer, were knighted. However, on 30 December of that year Browne wrote from Horsley to Sir William More regretting he could not accept an invitation at that time, although he hoped to be able to leave his \"dear friend Cornwallis' and travel before the twelve days of Christmas were up, adding, 'But I assure you I have been very weak and faint since Christmas\".\n\nIn the early 1590s Browne may have been the focus of Catholics who saw him as likely to soon inherit his father's estates. Shortly after Queen Elizabeth's visit to his father's house at Cowdray, Browne was denounced by the informer Robert Hammond to Lord Burghley for associating with Catholics whom the regime considered suspect. The Jesuit John Curry was reported by Viscount Montague's chaplain, Robert Gray, to have been residing at Riverbank House in Cowdray Park, and Thomas Simpson, who later preached Browne's funeral sermon, and had been ordained a priest in the early 1580s by the Cardinal of Guise, may also have been a visitor there.\n\nBrowne died at Riverbank House at Cowdray on 29 June 1592, predeceasing his father by four months, and was buried at Midhurst, Sussex. His widow, Mary Browne (née Dormer), married, secondly, to Sir Edmund Uvedale (died 1606), and thirdly, to Sir Thomas Gerard (died 1621), the son and heir of Sir Thomas Gerard.

However, on 30 December of that year Browne wrote from Horsley to Sir William More regretting he could not accept an invitation at that time, although he hoped to be able to leave his \"dear friend Cornwallis' and travel before the twelve days of Christmas were up, adding, 'But I assure you I have been very weak and faint since Christmas\".\n\nIn the early 1590s Browne may have been the focus of Catholics who saw him as likely to soon inherit his father's estates. Shortly after Queen Elizabeth's visit to his father's house at Cowdray, Browne was denounced by the informer Robert Hammond to Lord Burghley for associating with Catholics whom the regime considered suspect. The Jesuit John Curry was reported by Viscount Montague's chaplain, Robert Gray, to have been residing at Riverbank House in Cowdray Park, and Thomas Simpson, who later preached Browne's funeral sermon, and had been ordained a priest in the early 1580s by the Cardinal of Guise, may also have been a visitor there.\n\nBrowne died at Riverbank House at Cowdray on 29 June 1592, predeceasing his father by four months, and was buried at Midhurst, Sussex.

He had a twin sister, Mary (1552–1607; later Countess of Southampton), but their mother, Lady Jane, died in childbirth. Their grandfather was another Sir Anthony Browne (died 1548), knight of the shire for Surrey, and their great-grandfather, Sir Anthony Browne (died 1506) held the office of Standard Bearer of England. By 1558 their father, Lord Montagu, had married secondly Magdalen Dacre, by whom he had three further sons, George, Thomas and Henry, and three daughters, Elizabeth, Mabel and Jane.\n\nBrowne's relationship with his stepmother appears to have been close. She was said to have had \"so solicitous a care of his health as if he had been her own child\", and was so far from preferring her own children at Browne's expense that when an incident occurred which incurred Viscount Montagu's displeasure against his eldest son and heir, \"she pacified her husband\", and brought Browne into his father's favour again.\n\nIn 1572, Browne married Mary Dormer, a daughter of Sir William Dormer (died 1575) by his second wife, Dorothy Catesby. They had two sons, Anthony-Maria (born March 1574), who, shortly after his father's death in 1592, succeeded his grandfather as Viscount Montague, and John; and three daughters, Dorothy, who married Edmund Lee, Jane, who married Sir Francis Englefield, 1st Baronet (c. 1561 – c. 1631) and Katherine, who married John Tregonwell. In 1580, Browne was Sheriff of Surrey and of Kent, an office usually held for only one year.\n\nOn 19 February 1565/66, at the age of thirteen, Browne's twin sister, Mary, had married, from their father's house in London, Henry Wriothesley, 2nd Earl of Southampton. On 1 November 1573, a month after Mary had given birth to her son, Henry, the 2nd Earl wrote to Sir William More that he and his wife would stop at Loseley on their journey to London, which they were making in the company of \"my brother Anthony Browne and his wife\".\n\nHowever, this happy state of affairs did not long continue. Around 1577 the 2nd Earl, for reasons unknown, had forbidden Mary ever to see again a certain Donsame, \"a common person\". When, in, 1580 it was reported to him that she had been seen at Dogmersfield with Donsame, he forever banished her his 'board and presence', forcing her to live at one of his Hampshire estates under close surveillance. The Countess defended herself with spirit in a long letter to her father, Viscount Montague, on 21 March 1580, denying adultery and accusing one of the Earl's servants, Thomas Dymock, of having been the cause of the contention between herself and her husband. The two families and their servants were drawn into the trouble between Mary Browne and her husband.

A project group responsible for international standardization further developed the format and handed over a revised version to Object Management Group (OMG) as \"Request for Comment\" in 2010.\n\nAs the acronym RIF had an ambiguous meaning within the OMG, the new name ReqIF was introduced to separate it from the W3C's Rule Interchange Format.\n\nIn April 2011, the version 1.0.1 of ReqIF was adopted by OMG as a formal specification (OMG Document Number: formal/2011-04-02).\n\nIn October 2013, version 1.1 was published (OMG Document Number: formal/2013-10-01). Changes are restricted to the text of the standard, the XML schema and underlying model have not changed. Therefore, 1.1 and 1.0.1.reqif files are equivalent.\n\nIn July 2016, version 1.2 was published (OMG Document Number: formal/2016-07-01). Like with the previous versions, changes are restricted to the text of the standard, the XML schema and underlying model have not changed. Therefore, 1.2, 1.1 and 1.0.1.reqif files are equivalent.\n\n== Features ==\nReqIF is an exchange file format for exchanging requirements, attributes, additional files (e.g. images) across a chain of manufacturers, suppliers, sub-suppliers and the like. A GUID ensures unique identification of content across the process chain.\n\n== Application ==\nRequirements are typically elicited during the early phase of product development. This is the primary application of ReqIF, as development across organizations is happening more and more often. ReqIF allows for sharing of requirements between partners, even if different tools are used. In contrast to formats like Word, Excel or PDF, ReqIF allows for a loss-free exchange.\n\nReqIF was pioneered by automotive manufacturers, who started to demand the use of ReqIF in particular for the development of embedded controllers.\n\nReqIF is also used as the underlying data model for tool implementations. This is particularly true for the ReqIF Reference implementation (Eclipse RMF), which is being used by an implementer forum, that aims to ensure interoperability of various ReqIF implementations. ReqIF Server is another tool that natively uses ReqIF.\n\n== Operation ==\nRIF/ReqIF is a standardized meta-model, defined by an XML schema. Such files must conform to the schema and contain the description of the model (the datatypes), as well as the data. A successful data exchange between various tools only succeeds, if all parties agree on a common data model. The previously mentioned implementor forum is working on such a common model and also organizes tests with tools of the participating manufacturers, to ensure future interoperability.\n\n== Structure of ReqIF files ==\nAn OMG ReqIF file consists of XML with the root element REQ-IF, containing information regarding the file itself as well as the contained datatypes and requirements.\n\nThe containers for requirements in ReqIF are called specification objects (SpecObject), which have user-defined attributes.

The plates made by Portman are now scattered among several museums around the world and may be partly unpublished. He also wrote two books, Notes of the Languages of the South Andaman Group of Languages (1898) and A History of Our Relations with the Andamanese (1899).

His father was in turn the third son of Edward Portman, 1st Viscount Portman, and Emma Portman, Baroness Portman. He joined the Royal Indian Marine at the age of 16 and was some time in charge of the Viceroy's yacht. In July 1879 he was stationed at Port Blair in the Andaman Islands and made Officer in Charge of the Andamanese, a post which he held for more than 20 years with few interruptions (including December 1880 to December 1883 on sick leave, March 1887 to March 1888 on furlough).\n\n== Port Blair ==\nDuring his time as a colonial administrator at Port Blair, Portman took a large number of photographs of the Andamanese, including some at the request of British Museum (at his own expense) and the Government of India (on payment). Portman also undertook an expedition to North Sentinel Island to contact the previously uncontacted tribe inhabiting the island. During the expedition, the Sentinelese fled at the sight of the expedition, though his party kidnapped two adults and four children, taking them to the capital of the South Andaman Island, Port Blair. The adults died of illness soon after reaching Port Blair, and Portman ordered the children to be sent back with a large number of gifts after a few weeks. The illness carried by the returning children, who had acquired them in Port Blair, has been suggested by some as the cause of the hostility displayed by the Sentinelese towards outsiders.

He was the fourth of ten children of Ruggero Pascoli and Caterina Vincenzi Alloccatelli. His father was administrator of an estate of farm land of the Princes Torlonia on which the Pascoli family lived.\n\nOn the evening of 10 August 1867 as Ruggero Pascoli was returning home from the market at Cesena in a carriage drawn by a black and white mare (cavalla storna), he was shot and killed by an assassin hiding in a ditch by the road. The mare continued slowly on her way and brought home the body of her slain master. The murderer was never apprehended.\n\nGiovanni Pascoli had a tragic childhood, struck by the murder of his father and the early deaths of his mother, sister and two brothers, and the subsequent financial decline of the family. The father's assassination echoes in particular in one of his most popular poems, \"La cavalla storna\". His whole first work, Myricae (1891), reflects his unhappy childhood.\n\nIn 1871 he moved to Rimini with six of his brothers. Here he made friends with Andrea Costa, and began to participate in Socialist demonstrations. This led to another key event in Pascoli's life, his brief imprisonment in Bologna following a protest against the capture of the anarchist Giovanni Passannante, who attempted to kill Humbert I. Pascoli composed an Ode to Passannante, which he tore up soon after reading it during a socialist gathering in Bologna.\n\nPascoli studied at the University of Bologna, where his teacher and mentor was Giosuè Carducci. He graduated in 1882, and began to teach in high schools in Matera and Massa. He lived next to his sisters Ida and Maria, in an attempt to renew the original family, building a \"nest\" (as he called it) for the sisters and himself. Although he was almost married, it is speculated that he never did because of an immature and perhaps ambiguous relationship with his sisters.\n\nIn the same year, Pascoli dedicated a literary work to the memory of Giuseppe Garibaldi, a leading figure of the Italian Risorgimento movement, as well as to Carducci, his beloved teacher and close friend.\n\nIn the meantime he began to collaborate with the magazine Vita nuova, which published his first poems later collected in Myricae. In 1894 Pascoli was called to Rome to work for the Ministry of Public Instruction, and there he published the first version of Poemi conviviali. Later he moved between cities living in Bologna, Florence and Messina, but remained always psychologically rooted to his original, idealized peasant origins.\n\nIn 1895 he and his sister Maria moved into a house at Castelvecchio, near Barga, in Tuscany, bought with money gained from literary awards. The political and social turmoil of the early 20th century, which was to lead to Italy's participation in World War I and to the advent of Fascism, further strengthened Pascoli's insecurity and pessimism.\n\nFrom 1897 to 1903 he taught Latin at the University of Messina, and then in Pisa. When Carducci retired, Pascoli replaced him as professor of Italian literature at the University of Bologna. In 1912, already ill of cirrhosis (from alcohol abuse), Giovanni Pascoli died of liver cancer at the age of 56 in Bologna. An atheist, he was entombed in the chapel annexed to his house at Castelvecchio, where his beloved sister, Maria, would also be laid to rest.\n\n== Poetics ==\nAlthough he was not an active participant in any literary movement of the time, nor showed any particular propensity towards contemporary European poetry (as opposed to D'Annunzio), he manifests in his works mainly spiritualistic and idealistic tendencies, typical of late nineteenth century culture marked by the progressive exhaustion of Positivism.\n\nOverall his work appears to be followed by a constant tension between the old classicist tradition inherited from his teacher Giosuè Carducci, and the new themes of decadentism.\n\nHis poems center on domestic life and nature. However, even in that period of Positivism and scientism, Pascoli believed that life is a mystery; only symbolic associations discovered in the humble things of nature can lead man to catch a glimpse of the truth behind mere appearances. A core aspect of Pascoli's poetry at this time was his imagistic focus on small things (\"piccole cose\"). Pascoli abandoned the previous era's grandiose language and rhetoric, including that of his mentor Giosuè Carducci, for poetry that was simple and inspired by day-to-day life and objects. The title of his first collection ‘Myricae’ draws attention to this approach; it is widely regarded as a reference to Virgil's ‘humilesque myricae’, i.e. humble tamarisks. “Orchards and humble tamarisks don’t please everyone\" from Eclogues, IV. The Golden Age, Virgil.\n\nPascoli's later poems share similar themes but are more experimental, and reflect his knowledge of classical antiquity. They were a great influence on later Italian poets, who incorporated his melancholy themes into their own works. He wrote in both Italian and Latin; he also translated English poetry. His numerous poems in Latin gained many international awards.\n\nIn 1897 Pascoli issued a detailed definition of his poetical stance, which he called poetica del fanciullino (\"poetics of the child\") and which showed the influence of Sully and von Hartmann. Poetry, according to Pascoli, would be the unceasing capability to get stunned by the world, typical of childhood, secondarily connected to the expressive capabilities of the aged. In a refusal of both Classicism and Romanticism, Pascoli opposed both the renunciation of self-analysis and the abandonment of the self-centered point of view, in favour of a semi-irrational comfort which the poet gives himself through poetry.\n\nPascoli's poetry shows interesting affinities with European symbolism, even if direct influences cannot be demonstrated. A wide use of analogy and synesthesia, a very subtle musicality, a lexicon open both to foreign languages and to vernacular or onomatopeic voices are major signs of a literary research oriented towards modern poetical language.\n\nThe Nobel Laureate Seamus Heaney first encountered Pascoli's work in 2001 on a visit to Urbino. Heaney later translated and reworked Pascoli's ‘L’aquilone’ (‘The Kite’) which was published in 2009. Heaney went on to publish his translation of ‘L’ultima passeggiata’ (The Last Walk) which was published after his death in 2013 in a limited edition.\n\nVolumes of Pascoli's work in English include Last Voyage: Selected Poems of Giovanni Pascoli, translated by Richard Jackson, Deborah Brown, and Susan Thomas (Red Hen Press, 2010); Selected Poems of Giovanni Pascoli, translated by Taije Silverman and Marina Della Putta Johnston (Princeton University Press; 2019), and Last Dream, translated by Geoffrey Brock (World Poetry Books, 2019).

He lived next to his sisters Ida and Maria, in an attempt to renew the original family, building a \"nest\" (as he called it) for the sisters and himself. Although he was almost married, it is speculated that he never did because of an immature and perhaps ambiguous relationship with his sisters.\n\nIn the same year, Pascoli dedicated a literary work to the memory of Giuseppe Garibaldi, a leading figure of the Italian Risorgimento movement, as well as to Carducci, his beloved teacher and close friend.\n\nIn the meantime he began to collaborate with the magazine Vita nuova, which published his first poems later collected in Myricae. In 1894 Pascoli was called to Rome to work for the Ministry of Public Instruction, and there he published the first version of Poemi conviviali. Later he moved between cities living in Bologna, Florence and Messina, but remained always psychologically rooted to his original, idealized peasant origins.\n\nIn 1895 he and his sister Maria moved into a house at Castelvecchio, near Barga, in Tuscany, bought with money gained from literary awards. The political and social turmoil of the early 20th century, which was to lead to Italy's participation in World War I and to the advent of Fascism, further strengthened Pascoli's insecurity and pessimism.\n\nFrom 1897 to 1903 he taught Latin at the University of Messina, and then in Pisa. When Carducci retired, Pascoli replaced him as professor of Italian literature at the University of Bologna. In 1912, already ill of cirrhosis (from alcohol abuse), Giovanni Pascoli died of liver cancer at the age of 56 in Bologna. An atheist, he was entombed in the chapel annexed to his house at Castelvecchio, where his beloved sister, Maria, would also be laid to rest.\n\n== Poetics ==\nAlthough he was not an active participant in any literary movement of the time, nor showed any particular propensity towards contemporary European poetry (as opposed to D'Annunzio), he manifests in his works mainly spiritualistic and idealistic tendencies, typical of late nineteenth century culture marked by the progressive exhaustion of Positivism.\n\nOverall his work appears to be followed by a constant tension between the old classicist tradition inherited from his teacher Giosuè Carducci, and the new themes of decadentism.\n\nHis poems center on domestic life and nature. However, even in that period of Positivism and scientism, Pascoli believed that life is a mystery; only symbolic associations discovered in the humble things of nature can lead man to catch a glimpse of the truth behind mere appearances. A core aspect of Pascoli's poetry at this time was his imagistic focus on small things (\"piccole cose\"). Pascoli abandoned the previous era's grandiose language and rhetoric, including that of his mentor Giosuè Carducci, for poetry that was simple and inspired by day-to-day life and objects. The title of his first collection ‘Myricae’ draws attention to this approach; it is widely regarded as a reference to Virgil's ‘humilesque myricae’, i.e. humble tamarisks. “Orchards and humble tamarisks don’t please everyone\" from Eclogues, IV. The Golden Age, Virgil.\n\nPascoli's later poems share similar themes but are more experimental, and reflect his knowledge of classical antiquity. They were a great influence on later Italian poets, who incorporated his melancholy themes into their own works. He wrote in both Italian and Latin; he also translated English poetry. His numerous poems in Latin gained many international awards.\n\nIn 1897 Pascoli issued a detailed definition of his poetical stance, which he called poetica del fanciullino (\"poetics of the child\") and which showed the influence of Sully and von Hartmann. Poetry, according to Pascoli, would be the unceasing capability to get stunned by the world, typical of childhood, secondarily connected to the expressive capabilities of the aged. In a refusal of both Classicism and Romanticism, Pascoli opposed both the renunciation of self-analysis and the abandonment of the self-centered point of view, in favour of a semi-irrational comfort which the poet gives himself through poetry.\n\nPascoli's poetry shows interesting affinities with European symbolism, even if direct influences cannot be demonstrated. A wide use of analogy and synesthesia, a very subtle musicality, a lexicon open both to foreign languages and to vernacular or onomatopeic voices are major signs of a literary research oriented towards modern poetical language.\n\nThe Nobel Laureate Seamus Heaney first encountered Pascoli's work in 2001 on a visit to Urbino. Heaney later translated and reworked Pascoli's ‘L’aquilone’ (‘The Kite’) which was published in 2009. Heaney went on to publish his translation of ‘L’ultima passeggiata’ (The Last Walk) which was published after his death in 2013 in a limited edition.\n\nVolumes of Pascoli's work in English include Last Voyage: Selected Poems of Giovanni Pascoli, translated by Richard Jackson, Deborah Brown, and Susan Thomas (Red Hen Press, 2010); Selected Poems of Giovanni Pascoli, translated by Taije Silverman and Marina Della Putta Johnston (Princeton University Press; 2019), and Last Dream, translated by Geoffrey Brock (World Poetry Books, 2019). The latter was awarded the 2020 Raiziss/de Palchi Book Prize from the Academy of American Poets.\n\nPascoli was also known as a prose essayist and for his Dante studies. According to the Grand Orient of Italy, Pascoli was initiated in the Fremasonry by the Scottish Rite Grand Master Giosuè Carducci.\"\"\""}

He originally planned 55 floors for the building, but the owner of the Horsa Hotels network, entrepreneur Jose Tjurs, preferred to build only 34. Hotel Nacional opened in 1972 as a part of the Horsa Hotels network by entrepreneur Jose Tjurs. The 34-story São Conrado hotel was part of push to develop the western part of Rio.\n\nThe sleek modernist glass, aluminum and concrete building in the beachfront neighborhood of São Conrado housed a convention center for 2,800 people and a theater for approximately 1,400 spectators where artists such as Liza Minnelli, B.B. King, Chet Baker and James Brown have performed. It featured five restaurants, helicopter air taxi service from its helipad and original artwork and sculpture and played host to the Rio Film Festival in the 1980s. Considered the most modern hotel in Latin America when it opened, it quickly became a Brazilian design icon. The hotel was later renamed Hotel Horsa Nacional Rio.\n\nIn September 1976, the International Atomic Energy Agency held its twentieth regular session in the hotel's conference centre.\n\n== Decline ==\nAfter it closed in 1995, the hotel fell on hard times. After the interior fixtures and furnishings were removed — the structure was \"stripped for spare parts,\" even down to the elevators being removed from the shafts — the hotel became a home to squatters and a canvas for graffiti artists and bats which had been feeding off nearby coconut trees and took up residence in the convention center. Despite being landmarked by the city of Rio in 1998, there was no funding to restore it. However the 2016 Olympics provided the impetus for building up Rio's hotel industry.\n\nIn 2013, a wayward Justin Bieber was arrested for spray painting the interior of the hotel.\n\n== Restoration ==\nFor two decades, the building was abandoned and neglected, covered in graffiti. Businessman Marcelo Henrique Limírio Gonçalves bought the property in 2009 for $35 million. In January 2015, the architectural design firm VOA Brazil won the competition to design the retrofit of the entire building. VOA was challenged to respect the original design and to preserve some of the original interior elements while creating a modern hotel with contemporary amenities. The detailed renovation project involved contractor consultations with engineer Bruno Contarini, the structural designer who participated in the original construction of the building. VOA’s design efforts included the restoration of art works by renowned artists including the “Mermaid” sculpture by Alfredo Ceschiatti, the Carybé panel and the suspended sculpture by Pedro Corrêa de Araújo.\n\nThe project, estimated to cost $67 million financed by the company travel agency hurb.com, called for a 476-room hotel and an apartment annex boasting 240-plus units, as well as exhibition space, a spa and a Niemeyer Bar on the top floor. The apartments, convention space, and rooftop bar were never built, but the hotel reopened in January 2017 as the Gran Meliá Nacional Rio de Janeiro Hotel and from 2018 became Hurb a technology company that invest in Hotel Industry.\n\nOn March 12, 2018, Meliá Hotels ceased operating the hotel, as it lacked convention facilities and could not generate enough business to support itself. In addition, the Brazilian economic crisis and continuing high violent crime rates in the area contributed to the chain's decision. The owners of the hotel, a group of investors from Goiana, were reported to be looking for a chain to operate the property, but as of 2021 it remains independently operated as the Hotel Nacional Rio.\"\"\""}

When her father, Sharma (Om Puri), falls into a coma, her older sisters, Pria (Rita Wolf) and Rina (Amita Dhiri), get back in touch.\n\nMeanwhile, Sam is recruiting Uzi (Sonnell Dadral) for his underground record label, Monsoon. Sharma's friend and employee, Khan (Anupam Kher), (who is also Sam's father) intends on stopping the conniving Pria from selling Sharma's food factory, even though Mohan (Roshan Seth) warns Khan not to get involved and thinks it is justice for Sharma swindling them out of their share of the business. Jack and Heere go to Club 23 nightclub, where Heere meets Sam after years apart. They go back to his flat and embrace, but she regrets the encounter and leaves. Sharma wakes up on the day his daughters were set to turn off his life support machine. Sam continues his attempts to pursue Heere.\n\nHeere attends Sharma's puja with Jack where she is disowned by Sharma. Heere turns up with a friend at a meeting Sam is having with Jack. After Sam tells his elder brother, Firoz (Nitin Ganatra), that he has met Heere, and Firoz passes this along to Rina, Pria then tells Heere that there is a rumour that Heere and Sam are having a sexual relationship. Heere confronts Sam and they end up having sexual intercourse.\n\nSharma returns to work and sacks Khan after Khan reveals that Pria planned to sell the factory. Sam tells Khan (to Khan's dismay), that he wants to marry Heere. Firoz sides with the Sharmas and resents Khan for selling the factory. Khan then finds out Firoz and Rina are having an affair. After Heere rejects Sam, Sam ignores Khan's phone call and message and starts a sexual relationship with his colleague, Amba (Shelley Conn). The next morning Sam finds Khan after he has hanged himself.\n\n== Part Two ==\nSam and Firoz attend Khan's janazah (funeral prayer). During Khan's wake, Heere's attempts to console Sam fall on deaf ears. A drunk Mohan tells Sharma the truth about Khan and Sharma's daughters. Sharma realises the truth and gives his employees paid leave until the problems are sorted out.\n\nSam goes to work to find that Jez (Jay Simpson) and Paul (William Beck), from the non-independent label Zenon, are pitching a deal for Uzi to his business partner, Parv (Chris Ryman). Sam fears that they want to buy out Uzi, and turn Monsoon from a community-based label into a commercial product. This distresses Sam because he thinks artistic development is more important than money.\n\nMeanwhile, Pria, Rina, and Firoz have Sharma sectioned with the help of Rina's GP husband, Arun (Shiv Grewal). Heere visits Sharma, who mistakes her for her mother, Sonali. Jack refuses Heere's request for Sharma to move in with them. Sam reluctantly signs a takeover deal for Monsoon to join Zenon. At the celebration boat party, Heere rejects Uzi's advances; and Jack suspects Sam and Heere are having sex, leading to a fight with Sam. Meanwhile, Rina plans on leaving Arun for Firoz.\n\nHeere brings Sharma to her house, where he breaks down. Out of guilt, Firoz breaks up with Rina. Pria reveals to Heere that she found their mother after she committed suicide and resents their father for abandoning their mother. Heere's application to be Sharma's carer fails and she reconciles with her sisters.\n\nPria sells the factory and Firoz is made the managing director. Heere ends her relationship with Jack, goes to Club 23, tells Sam how she feels about him and that she is leaving for India, and with Mohan's help smuggles Sharma out of the care home onto a flight to India. Sam apologises to Amba, gives Parv sole ownership of Monsoon and leaves the nightclub.\n\nSam meets Heere and Sharma in Calcutta. Sam and Heere rekindle their romantic relationship.\n\n== Overview ==\nSet in east London and Calcutta, Second Generation tells the story tangled relationships of two Indian Bengali families, who emigrated to Britain in the 1970s.

Each character has a set of attacks and abilities. The majority of attacks are used with B, including the combo (1st, 2nd, and 3rd Attack), Air Attack, Upper Attack (used to knock opponents straight up), Heavy Attack (used to knock opponents away), and Aim Attack (used to pursue an opponent after the Heavy Attack). The A button is used to jump, and the L button lets the player block attacks, or heal damage if the button is held. The playable characters also have unique special moves, the three types being Shot, Power, and Set. Shot moves center around using a projectile to damage the opponent from a distance. Power moves focus on dealing damage quickly in a single move. Trap moves generally involve using a type of bomb to surprise-attack the enemy. However, only a limited number of special moves can be selected. Shot, Power, and Trap must be allocated to three slots: Ground, Air, and Defend. The special move you set to Ground will be used when you press R on the ground. The move you set to Air will be used when you press R in mid-air. The last slot, Defend, has a different function; When a player sets a certain type of special move to Defend, then every time an enemy uses the same type of special move set to Defend to attack, it will automatically be blocked.\n\nEach player has two vital stats, a health bar and an Ichikoro Gauge. When health is completely depleted, the player is KO'd and loses one life (in a survival match) or the one who KO'd them gets a point (in a KO match). The Ground, Air, and Defend settings are chosen at the beginning of the match, and every time the player respawns. As a player takes damage, blocks attacks, or heals, the Ichikoro Gauge fills up. When it is full, the next special move the player does will instantly KO anyone it hits. However, if they chose to defend against that type of special, or successfully block, their Ichikoro Gauge will be filled instantly. Players healing damage will also slowly fill up their Ichikoro Gauge, but are still vulnerable to attacks.\n\n== Characters ==\nThe game features ten playable characters. Eight are playable in the game's Story Mode: Sonic the Hedgehog, Miles \"Tails\" Prower, Knuckles the Echidna, Amy Rose, Shadow the Hedgehog, Rouge the Bat, Cream the Rabbit, and the original character Emerl. By defeating opponents in the Story Mode, the player will gain \"skill cards\", which Emerl can equip to customize his moveset and utilize other characters' abilities. Two additional characters, E-102 Gamma and Chaos, can be unlocked for use in Battle Mode and Challenge Mode after they are defeated in Story Mode.\n\n== Minigames ==\nThe game includes five mini-games. The only mini-game available at the beginning of the game is \"Soniclash\", in which players try to knock their opponents off the fighting arena to gather points. In \"Tails' Fly and Get\", players fly around and try to collect more rings than their opponents. \"Knuckles' Mine Hunt\" is a single-player game based on the computer game Minesweeper. In \"Amy's Treasure Island\", players move around and search for emeralds. In \"Shadow's Speed Demon\", the players race against each other.\n\n== Plot ==\nWhile studying the diary of his grandfather, Professor Gerald Robotnik, Dr. Eggman learns of an artifact Gerald had unearthed: a 4000-year-old sentient weapon called the Gizoid created by an ancient civilization. Eggman attempts to get the dormant Gizoid to work properly, but is unsuccessful and abandons it at Emerald Beach. Sonic the Hedgehog finds the Gizoid, which activates and develops a link with him after Sonic demonstrates his abilities.\n\nThe Gizoid, which Sonic names Emerl due to its ability to use the Chaos Emeralds, demonstrates an ability to perfectly replicate any moves it sees and quickly gets wrapped up in the affairs of Sonic's friends, allies and rivals. Through his encounters with Tails, Rouge, Knuckles, Amy, Cream, and Shadow, Emerl learns of the world and of concepts like friendship. As they train together, the group discovers that Emerl becomes stronger and develops more sentience with each Chaos Emerald that he obtains, and begin searching for the remaining Emeralds to help the robot develop. While searching, they are repeatedly attacked by the forces of Eggman, who now wants to retrieve the weapon, including a rebuilt E-102 Gamma and a series of imperfect Emerl duplicates under the name \"E-121 Phi\".\n\nEventually, all the Chaos Emeralds are obtained and Emerl achieves full sapience. In a last attempt, Eggman decides to lure Emerl onto his new Death Egg to capture him. The two battle, and Emerl emerges victorious, but Eggman uses his new Final Egg Blaster to force Emerl to override his link with Sonic with Eggman's own. However, this overloads Emerl, deleting his personality and causing him to go haywire. The rogue Gizoid then turns the blaster towards the planet, and Sonic is sent to stop him before the world is destroyed. Sonic defeats Emerl, who briefly reverts to his previous personality and bids his friends farewell before overloading with energy and exploding, leaving the shards of the Chaos Emeralds he acquired behind. Sonic returns home to his friends, who are saddened by the loss of Emerl. When asked if he believes Emerl is truly gone, Sonic reassures everyone that they will see him again someday.\n\n== Development and release ==\nThe game was officially announced at the 2003 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) and Tokyo Game Show, both of which featured playable demos. The game was released in late-2003 in Japan as part of the \"Year of Sonic\", and early-2004 by THQ in the United States following a deal between both companies. Internationally, the game was co-published by Sega Europe and THQ.\n\n== Reception ==\nThe game received generally mixed reviews from critics, according to review aggregator site Metacritic. While some critics praised the game's \"surprisingly deep arena-fighting gameplay\", graphics, and multiplayer mode, others dismissed it for its \"limited moveset\" and use of 2D sprites on a 3D fighting arena.\n\nIGN gave the game a positive review, saying \"It does try hard to be what Smash Bros. is, and even though the game doesn't quite reach the same status Nintendo and HAL created for the Nintendo consoles, Sonic Battle has enough stuff to make it one of the top original fighters on the Game Boy Advance system.\" GameSpy also gave a positive review, saying \"A solid and pleasantly deep arena beat-'em-up with lots of longevity, and though the presence of the Hedgehog and his posse adds absolutely nothing to the game, it's nice to see them getting work in these tough economic times.\" Nintendo Power gave a more mixed review, saying, \"Moves are limited, but the overall experience is tons of fun.\" GamePro also gave a mixed review, criticizing the game's story mode, saying \"The biggest problem with Sonic Battle is the poor game design in Story mode. Earning Skill Points, and thereby new abilities for Emerl the Robot, is a grueling ordeal.\"", "src": "== Gameplay ==\nBattles are fought in 3D arenas with up to four players.

Two additional characters, E-102 Gamma and Chaos, can be unlocked for use in Battle Mode and Challenge Mode after they are defeated in Story Mode.\n\n== Minigames ==\nThe game includes five mini-games. The only mini-game available at the beginning of the game is \"Soniclash\", in which players try to knock their opponents off the fighting arena to gather points. In \"Tails' Fly and Get\", players fly around and try to collect more rings than their opponents. \"Knuckles' Mine Hunt\" is a single-player game based on the computer game Minesweeper. In \"Amy's Treasure Island\", players move around and search for emeralds. In \"Shadow's Speed Demon\", the players race against each other.\n\n== Plot ==\nWhile studying the diary of his grandfather, Professor Gerald Robotnik, Dr. Eggman learns of an artifact Gerald had unearthed: a 4000-year-old sentient weapon called the Gizoid created by an ancient civilization. Eggman attempts to get the dormant Gizoid to work properly, but is unsuccessful and abandons it at Emerald Beach. Sonic the Hedgehog finds the Gizoid, which activates and develops a link with him after Sonic demonstrates his abilities.\n\nThe Gizoid, which Sonic names Emerl due to its ability to use the Chaos Emeralds, demonstrates an ability to perfectly replicate any moves it sees and quickly gets wrapped up in the affairs of Sonic's friends, allies and rivals. Through his encounters with Tails, Rouge, Knuckles, Amy, Cream, and Shadow, Emerl learns of the world and of concepts like friendship. As they train together, the group discovers that Emerl becomes stronger and develops more sentience with each Chaos Emerald that he obtains, and begin searching for the remaining Emeralds to help the robot develop. While searching, they are repeatedly attacked by the forces of Eggman, who now wants to retrieve the weapon, including a rebuilt E-102 Gamma and a series of imperfect Emerl duplicates under the name \"E-121 Phi\".\n\nEventually, all the Chaos Emeralds are obtained and Emerl achieves full sapience. In a last attempt, Eggman decides to lure Emerl onto his new Death Egg to capture him. The two battle, and Emerl emerges victorious, but Eggman uses his new Final Egg Blaster to force Emerl to override his link with Sonic with Eggman's own. However, this overloads Emerl, deleting his personality and causing him to go haywire. The rogue Gizoid then turns the blaster towards the planet, and Sonic is sent to stop him before the world is destroyed. Sonic defeats Emerl, who briefly reverts to his previous personality and bids his friends farewell before overloading with energy and exploding, leaving the shards of the Chaos Emeralds he acquired behind. Sonic returns home to his friends, who are saddened by the loss of Emerl. When asked if he believes Emerl is truly gone, Sonic reassures everyone that they will see him again someday.\n\n== Development and release ==\nThe game was officially announced at the 2003 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) and Tokyo Game Show, both of which featured playable demos.

Each character has a set of attacks and abilities. The majority of attacks are used with B, including the combo (1st, 2nd, and 3rd Attack), Air Attack, Upper Attack (used to knock opponents straight up), Heavy Attack (used to knock opponents away), and Aim Attack (used to pursue an opponent after the Heavy Attack). The A button is used to jump, and the L button lets the player block attacks, or heal damage if the button is held. The playable characters also have unique special moves, the three types being Shot, Power, and Set. Shot moves center around using a projectile to damage the opponent from a distance. Power moves focus on dealing damage quickly in a single move. Trap moves generally involve using a type of bomb to surprise-attack the enemy. However, only a limited number of special moves can be selected. Shot, Power, and Trap must be allocated to three slots: Ground, Air, and Defend. The special move you set to Ground will be used when you press R on the ground. The move you set to Air will be used when you press R in mid-air. The last slot, Defend, has a different function; When a player sets a certain type of special move to Defend, then every time an enemy uses the same type of special move set to Defend to attack, it will automatically be blocked.\n\nEach player has two vital stats, a health bar and an Ichikoro Gauge. When health is completely depleted, the player is KO'd and loses one life (in a survival match) or the one who KO'd them gets a point (in a KO match). The Ground, Air, and Defend settings are chosen at the beginning of the match, and every time the player respawns. As a player takes damage, blocks attacks, or heals, the Ichikoro Gauge fills up. When it is full, the next special move the player does will instantly KO anyone it hits. However, if they chose to defend against that type of special, or successfully block, their Ichikoro Gauge will be filled instantly. Players healing damage will also slowly fill up their Ichikoro Gauge, but are still vulnerable to attacks.\n\n== Characters ==\nThe game features ten playable characters. Eight are playable in the game's Story Mode: Sonic the Hedgehog, Miles \"Tails\" Prower, Knuckles the Echidna, Amy Rose, Shadow the Hedgehog, Rouge the Bat, Cream the Rabbit, and the original character Emerl.

Toriyasu thinks he ran off, but Meeko claims it was an alien abduction. Though Toriyasu mocks Meeko for her over-imaginative ways, she isn't far off from the truth. On the way to school, Meeko sees what looks like a cat in clothes slipping into the shadows. Later that evening, three anthropomorphic feline scientists, Henoji, Suttoboke and HoiHoi go into Toriyasu and Meeko's room intending to take Toriyasu with them on a trip. Instead they end up waking and taking Meeko as well. She accompanies them in their vehicle (a balloon that resembles a cheshire cat) with a tired Toriyasu.\n\nThe cats soon reach their own world: Banipal Witt, a world of incredibly strange variety. Suddenly, they run into the Sleeping Cat, the very support of Banipal Witt. If the Sleeping Cat wakes, their world would be destroyed. The two children soon find that Banipal Witt is far different than their home: Three minutes in the human world is one day in Banipal Witt and the cats are only anthropomorphic in Banipal Witt (Henoji having remarked that, because of the human world, their life expectancy has decreased). Both Toriyasu and Meeko are turned into anthropomorphic kittens by the sun of Banipal Witt (which is magical in nature) as soon as they set foot on Banipal Witt.\n\nSoon, the kids meet the leader of a resistance: Master Sandada, a powerful wizard. Sadly, in the absence of the trio sent to find Toriyasu and Meeko, Sandada has fallen victim to a curse from Lady Buburina, a dictator-like princess that has gone insane and (due to an enchantment) turns anyone she touches into a balloon. Sandada was unable to protect himself, because his last line of defense- a mystic glove called the Sorcerer's Arm -was stolen by DohDoh, his apprentice that had fallen to insanity due to a curse. Master Sandada explains that he brought Toriyasu here to catch Papadoll, who has supposedly been wreaking havoc across Banipal Witt.\n\nChuChu, DohDoh's younger sister and the strongest fighter for the resistance, comes to warn that Papadoll has been abducting more villagers and is approaching their location fast. Papadoll soon arrives and the kids can't believe their eyes: Their dog has been turned into a giant, flying monster. DohDoh leaves Sandada with an ultimatum from Buburina: If Sandada doesn't surrender before the next sunrise, great disaster shall befall Banipal Witt. Meeko manages to get Papadoll to calm down, but an interruption from Toriyasu sends Papadoll into a fit of rage. In the confusion, Meeko is taken hostage and things begin to look grim.\n\nSome time later, Sandada explains that when a creature from another world is touched by the sun twice, they become what Papadoll has become. Expectedly, Toriyasu freaks out, demanding to go home, but the others manage to reason with him because he needs to save his sister.\n\nMeanwhile, at the palace, the prisoners (including Meeko) attempt to break out. Meeko comes close, but ends up trapped near the throne room. Listening in on a conversation between Buburina and her parents, she finds out that Buburina's power is supposed to be a punishment that was cast by a wizard who sought revenge against her for sending his daughter to her death (even though Buburina claimed that it wasn't her fault).\n\nBack at Sandada's manor, Toriyasu (along with Henoji, Suttoboke, HoiHoi and ChuChu) are sent by Sandada to Buburina's palace to knock Papadoll out with a pill that contains sleeping powder that Sandada claims would make an animal like Papadoll sleep for a week and Papadoll's chain. Before leaving, Sandada says that only Toriyasu has the power to turn Papadoll back to normal.\n\nLater that night, Buburina calls an assembly to inform her prisoners of their fate. She tells her prisoners of her plan to create a giant mouse that would be used to wake the Sleeping Cat should anyone rebel against her, sending Banipal Witt into turmoil. Meeko, however, ridicules Buburina's plan, claiming that Papadoll wouldn't do that. Meeko demands the return of Papadoll and insults the princess by calling her a witch. Buburina, having been upset by Meeko's insult, tries to turn her into a balloon and pop her, but finds she cannot (the curse only affects people from Banipal Witt). Realizing that Meeko is a human, Buburina plans to make Meeko her new monster slave once the sun rises. She then turns all her prisoners into balloons (so that she can finish her mouse balloon) and throws Meeko inside also.\n\nUnder cover of night, Toriyasu and the others prepare to sneak into the castle to free Papadoll and save Meeko. Unfortunately, the plan goes awry, as Toriyasu accidentally wakes Buburina up when the rope he is on slips, setting off alarms all over the castle. Toriyasu and ChuChu make an escape, while Suttoboke (who broke off from the group because he got Meeko's scent) runs into DohDoh in an attempt to save Meeko.\n\nQuickly, Toriyasu and ChuChu (after having a bonding moment) regroup in time to see Suttoboke and Meeko release the mouse balloon. With Buburina's plan falling apart at the seams, DohDoh goes to try to kill Meeko and Suttoboke, while Toriyasu and ChuChu go to try to get Papadoll under control and stop Buburina.\n\nIn the ensuing air battle, Toriyasu suffers through a temporary depression caused by DohDoh's taunting (having remembered a time when he beat Papadoll to release some built-up anger that had been caused by teasing from three neighborhood bullies). DohDoh, however, is dealt a hard fate by karma, as he breaks the mouse balloon when he gets too close to the castle and loses his hold on the Sorcerer's Arm. Toriyasu, remembering what Master Sandada had said before he left, regains faith in himself and tries to take Papadoll back. Buburina, however, refuses to give back Papadoll and nearly makes Toriyasu fall to his death after Buburina tears Papadoll's collar off.\n\nDuring his fall, Papadoll finally remembers Toriyasu (having ignored Buburina's orders to eat Toriyasu) and Toriyasu remembers how much Papadoll means to him (shown in flashback form). Toriyasu then goes insane for only a few seconds before regaining composure after landing on one of Buburina's victims. Using the victim as a means of transportation (even though the said victim tries to protest as best he can to this idea), he reaches Papadoll (avoiding seeking missiles fired by Buburina) and regains control of him with ChuChu's help. However, the signal tower (the enormous flare gun-like device that lights Banipal Witt's sun every morning) goes off, leaving Toriyasu and the others only a few seconds to save Meeko.\n\nQuickly, they rescue Meeko and make it home. Buburina and DohDoh both end up with miserable fates: Buburina is left sinking into a small lake, and DohDoh tangled in what remains of the mouse balloon.\n\nToriyasu and Meeko return to normal (no longer transformed by Banipal Witt's sun), Toriyasu and ChuChu develop a relationship and the cats say that the two can visit any time and they can also choose to be cats again if they want. Before returning home, Meeko makes a prediction that Buburina will make a comeback.\n\nThe next morning, Toriyasu and Meeko return to a normal life. Unbeknownst to the children, Meeko is right again: The cats go to Toriyasu and Meeko's school due to some urgent business that came up only recently, leaving the movie on a cliffhanger.\n\n== Staff ==\nSources:\n\n== Cast ==\nThe actors are listed original voice actor first, English voice actor second.", "src": "== Plot ==\nFor a whole week, Toriyasu and his little sister, Meeko, have been missing their pet dog, Papadoll.

Meeko manages to get Papadoll to calm down, but an interruption from Toriyasu sends Papadoll into a fit of rage. In the confusion, Meeko is taken hostage and things begin to look grim.\n\nSome time later, Sandada explains that when a creature from another world is touched by the sun twice, they become what Papadoll has become. Expectedly, Toriyasu freaks out, demanding to go home, but the others manage to reason with him because he needs to save his sister.\n\nMeanwhile, at the palace, the prisoners (including Meeko) attempt to break out. Meeko comes close, but ends up trapped near the throne room. Listening in on a conversation between Buburina and her parents, she finds out that Buburina's power is supposed to be a punishment that was cast by a wizard who sought revenge against her for sending his daughter to her death (even though Buburina claimed that it wasn't her fault).\n\nBack at Sandada's manor, Toriyasu (along with Henoji, Suttoboke, HoiHoi and ChuChu) are sent by Sandada to Buburina's palace to knock Papadoll out with a pill that contains sleeping powder that Sandada claims would make an animal like Papadoll sleep for a week and Papadoll's chain. Before leaving, Sandada says that only Toriyasu has the power to turn Papadoll back to normal.\n\nLater that night, Buburina calls an assembly to inform her prisoners of their fate. She tells her prisoners of her plan to create a giant mouse that would be used to wake the Sleeping Cat should anyone rebel against her, sending Banipal Witt into turmoil. Meeko, however, ridicules Buburina's plan, claiming that Papadoll wouldn't do that. Meeko demands the return of Papadoll and insults the princess by calling her a witch. Buburina, having been upset by Meeko's insult, tries to turn her into a balloon and pop her, but finds she cannot (the curse only affects people from Banipal Witt). Realizing that Meeko is a human, Buburina plans to make Meeko her new monster slave once the sun rises. She then turns all her prisoners into balloons (so that she can finish her mouse balloon) and throws Meeko inside also.\n\nUnder cover of night, Toriyasu and the others prepare to sneak into the castle to free Papadoll and save Meeko. Unfortunately, the plan goes awry, as Toriyasu accidentally wakes Buburina up when the rope he is on slips, setting off alarms all over the castle. Toriyasu and ChuChu make an escape, while Suttoboke (who broke off from the group because he got Meeko's scent) runs into DohDoh in an attempt to save Meeko.\n\nQuickly, Toriyasu and ChuChu (after having a bonding moment) regroup in time to see Suttoboke and Meeko release the mouse balloon. With Buburina's plan falling apart at the seams, DohDoh goes to try to kill Meeko and Suttoboke, while Toriyasu and ChuChu go to try to get Papadoll under control and stop Buburina.\n\nIn the ensuing air battle, Toriyasu suffers through a temporary depression caused by DohDoh's taunting (having remembered a time when he beat Papadoll to release some built-up anger that had been caused by teasing from three neighborhood bullies). DohDoh, however, is dealt a hard fate by karma, as he breaks the mouse balloon when he gets too close to the castle and loses his hold on the Sorcerer's Arm. Toriyasu, remembering what Master Sandada had said before he left, regains faith in himself and tries to take Papadoll back. Buburina, however, refuses to give back Papadoll and nearly makes Toriyasu fall to his death after Buburina tears Papadoll's collar off.\n\nDuring his fall, Papadoll finally remembers Toriyasu (having ignored Buburina's orders to eat Toriyasu) and Toriyasu remembers how much Papadoll means to him (shown in flashback form). Toriyasu then goes insane for only a few seconds before regaining composure after landing on one of Buburina's victims. Using the victim as a means of transportation (even though the said victim tries to protest as best he can to this idea), he reaches Papadoll (avoiding seeking missiles fired by Buburina) and regains control of him with ChuChu's help. However, the signal tower (the enormous flare gun-like device that lights Banipal Witt's sun every morning) goes off, leaving Toriyasu and the others only a few seconds to save Meeko.\n\nQuickly, they rescue Meeko and make it home. Buburina and DohDoh both end up with miserable fates: Buburina is left sinking into a small lake, and DohDoh tangled in what remains of the mouse balloon.\n\nToriyasu and Meeko return to normal (no longer transformed by Banipal Witt's sun), Toriyasu and ChuChu develop a relationship and the cats say that the two can visit any time and they can also choose to be cats again if they want. Before returning home, Meeko makes a prediction that Buburina will make a comeback.\n\nThe next morning, Toriyasu and Meeko return to a normal life. Unbeknownst to the children, Meeko is right again: The cats go to Toriyasu and Meeko's school due to some urgent business that came up only recently, leaving the movie on a cliffhanger.\n\n== Staff ==\nSources:\n\n== Cast ==\nThe actors are listed original voice actor first, English voice actor second.", "page_title": "Catnapped!", "word_tertile": "medium", "trgt": "Totsuzen!

Toriyasu thinks he ran off, but Meeko claims it was an alien abduction. Though Toriyasu mocks Meeko for her over-imaginative ways, she isn't far off from the truth. On the way to school, Meeko sees what looks like a cat in clothes slipping into the shadows. Later that evening, three anthropomorphic feline scientists, Henoji, Suttoboke and HoiHoi go into Toriyasu and Meeko's room intending to take Toriyasu with them on a trip. Instead they end up waking and taking Meeko as well. She accompanies them in their vehicle (a balloon that resembles a cheshire cat) with a tired Toriyasu.\n\nThe cats soon reach their own world: Banipal Witt, a world of incredibly strange variety. Suddenly, they run into the Sleeping Cat, the very support of Banipal Witt. If the Sleeping Cat wakes, their world would be destroyed. The two children soon find that Banipal Witt is far different than their home: Three minutes in the human world is one day in Banipal Witt and the cats are only anthropomorphic in Banipal Witt (Henoji having remarked that, because of the human world, their life expectancy has decreased). Both Toriyasu and Meeko are turned into anthropomorphic kittens by the sun of Banipal Witt (which is magical in nature) as soon as they set foot on Banipal Witt.\n\nSoon, the kids meet the leader of a resistance: Master Sandada, a powerful wizard. Sadly, in the absence of the trio sent to find Toriyasu and Meeko, Sandada has fallen victim to a curse from Lady Buburina, a dictator-like princess that has gone insane and (due to an enchantment) turns anyone she touches into a balloon. Sandada was unable to protect himself, because his last line of defense- a mystic glove called the Sorcerer's Arm -was stolen by DohDoh, his apprentice that had fallen to insanity due to a curse. Master Sandada explains that he brought Toriyasu here to catch Papadoll, who has supposedly been wreaking havoc across Banipal Witt.\n\nChuChu, DohDoh's younger sister and the strongest fighter for the resistance, comes to warn that Papadoll has been abducting more villagers and is approaching their location fast. Papadoll soon arrives and the kids can't believe their eyes: Their dog has been turned into a giant, flying monster. DohDoh leaves Sandada with an ultimatum from Buburina: If Sandada doesn't surrender before the next sunrise, great disaster shall befall Banipal Witt. Meeko manages to get Papadoll to calm down, but an interruption from Toriyasu sends Papadoll into a fit of rage.

The name \"Shelburne\" or \"Shelburn\" was chosen to honor William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne, a celebrated nobleman of the British parliament and Prime Minister. According to the charter, the town was to have an area of 23,500 acres (95.1 km2), or a tract a little over 6 square miles (15.5 km2), but owing to a blunder on the part of the surveyors, it was shorn of a large portion of its possessions.\n\nFrom the beginning, Shelburne's economy was based on farming. With the clearing of land and burning of logs the town experienced a potash boom. A carding and fulling mill, a gristmill, a sawmill, and a blacksmith shop were erected on the La Platte River at Shelburne Falls. In 1811, a few Merino sheep imported from Spain led to an upsurge in sheep raising. Orchards and fruit growing became a major source of income for the farmers, with some 17,740 trees in 1880.

With the clearing of land and burning of logs the town experienced a potash boom. A carding and fulling mill, a gristmill, a sawmill, and a blacksmith shop were erected on the La Platte River at Shelburne Falls. In 1811, a few Merino sheep imported from Spain led to an upsurge in sheep raising. Orchards and fruit growing became a major source of income for the farmers, with some 17,740 trees in 1880. Following the War of 1812, commerce on the lake expanded rapidly.\n\nThe Lake Champlain Transportation Company established its shipyard at Shelburne Harbor and launched its first steamboat, the General Green, in 1825; this was followed by ten others before the Ticonderoga in 1906. In 1955, the Ticonderoga was moved overland to the Shelburne Museum, where it is now on display.\n\n== Geography ==\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 45.1 square miles (116.7 km2), of which 24.3 square miles (63.0 km2) is land and 20.8 square miles (53.8 km2), or 46.06%, is water (primarily Lake Champlain, but also including Shelburne Pond in the eastern part of town).\n\n== Government and politics ==\nThe town had the highest voter turnout in Vermont in the general election of 2008 with 89.4%. It had the highest number of registered voters among the top ten towns with the highest turnout. It also had the second-highest percentage of people voting absentee of any town in Vermont, 50.2%.\n\nIn the Vermont Democratic Party presidential primary of 2016, the town was the worst-performing of all municipalities in both Chittenden County and the Burlington metro area for U.S. senator Bernie Sanders of nearby Burlington. Bernie Sanders received 76.6% of the Democratic primary vote in the town and former U.S. secretary of state Hillary Clinton received her highest level of support for any municipality in the county and metro area, at 23.1%. Kathryn Webb and Jessica Brumsted, both Democrats, represent the town in the Vermont House of Representatives.\n\n== Demographics ==\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 6,944 people, 2,632 households, and 1,845 families residing in the town. The population density was 285.6 people per square mile (110.3/km2). There were 2,741 housing units at an average density of 112.8 per square mile (43.5/km2). The racial makeup of the town was 97.60% White, 0.23% African American, 0.10% Native American, 1.01% Asian, 0.32% from other races, and 0.75% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 0.86% of the population.\n\nThere were 2,632 households, out of which 37.6% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 61.3% were couples living together and joined in either marriage or civil union, 6.7% had a female householder with no husband present, and 29.9% were non-families. 22.9% of all households were made up of individuals, and 11.7% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.58 and the average family size was 3.08.\n\nIn the town, the population was spread out, with 27.6% under the age of 18, 3.9% from 18 to 24, 25.9% from 25 to 44, 27.2% from 45 to 64, and 15.4% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 41 years. For every 100 females, there were 90.9 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 86.3 males.\n\n== Economy ==\nThe town contains businesses, including manufacturers, service providers, retail establishments and the state's largest continuing care retirement community. In 2007 a historic inn was converted into a mixed use array of offices, small retail, and a restaurant.\n\n== Personal income ==\nIn 2016, the median income for a household in the town was $98,898, and the median income for a family was $118,492. Males had a median income of $50,085 versus $28,428 for females. The per capita income for the town was $55,638. About 2.9% of families and 4.9% of the population were below the poverty line, including 2.7% of those under age 18 and 7.6% of those age 65 or over.\n\n== Tourism ==\nThe town has three major tourist attractions: the Shelburne Museum, Shelburne Farms, and the Vermont Teddy Bear Company. Also attracting tourists to Shelburne are: Shelburne Vineyard and Fiddlehead Brewery.\n\nThe town maintains a beach on Lake Champlain which has a boat launch and nature park.\n\nU.S. Route 7 (Shelburne Road) crosses the center of town, leading north into South Burlington and south towards Vergennes.\n\nBus service is provided by Green Mountain Transit.\n\n== Schools ==\nThe town is part of the Champlain valley School District and sends students of high school age to Champlain Valley Union High School in Hinesburg.\n\n== Media ==\nThe Shelburne News is a weekly newspaper mailed to all residents of Shelburne. It was established in 1967. In 2017, it was sold to the owners of the Stowe Reporter who then created the Vermont Community Newspaper Group in 2019.\"\"\""}

The Gamō clan were given Aizu to govern under the Uesugi, and Tairō Uesugi Kagekatsu gave his karō (advisor) Naoe Kanetsugu a 300,000 koku income.\n\nIn 1600, however, the Uesugi opposed Tokugawa Ieyasu in the Sekigahara Campaign, and lost, becoming tozama daimyō (outsider lords) under the new shogunate. Their income and territory worth 1,200,000 koku was reduced to 300,000, and they were forced to leave their holdings in Aizu, and were allowed to keep only Yonezawa, which they recovered from Naoe Kanetsugu. Their new domain thus consisted of 180,000 koku in Dewa Province, and 120,000 koku in neighboring Mutsu province. This 300,000 koku territory would represent the peak of the Uesugi clan's income during the Tokugawa period.\n\nAs with most of the han, Yonezawa acted as a semi-independent state, ruled directly by its daimyō. The Uesugi demanded respect for the shogunate from their retainers, and forbade public criticism, but only imposed and enforced those edicts and policies set by the central authorities which they chose to. Retainers were ordered to obey shogunal laws while outside the domain, but within it, shogunal orders did not apply unless conveyed by the daimyō.\n\nIn 1664, the third daimyō of Yonezawa, Uesugi Tsunakatsu, died without producing an heir. The succession was determined at the advice of his father-in-law, Hoshina Masayuki, the younger brother to shōgun Tokugawa Iemitsu. He suggested that the clan adopt Uesugi Tsunanori, the son of Tsunakatsu's younger sister and Kira Yoshinaka as heir, although this would mean splitting the domain in half, down to only the 150,000 koku portion within Dewa province. This decision led to severe financial difficulties in the domain, for the Uesugi and their administration, and for the increasingly impoverished peasants. The problem became so severe that the eighth daimyō, Uesugi Shigetada, seriously considered surrendering the domain to the shogunate. Instead, he resigned his position as daimyō in favor of Uesugi Harunori, who then began to reform the domain's administration and to revive its economy. He introduced strict disciplinary measures, and ordered the execution of several karō who opposed his plans. In order to finance castle repairs imposed upon his domain by the shogunate, Harunori asked his retainers to agree to a reduction of their stipends. As a result of these various measures, Yonezawa again became fairly prosperous, and did not suffer much from the great famine which swept Japan in the Tenmei era (1781–89). In 1830, the shogunate formally declared Yonezawa to be a choice example of a well-governed domain.\n\nThe domain had a population of 127,277 people in 23,440 households per the 1870 census. It maintained its primary residence (kamiyashiki) in Edo near the Sakurada-mon gate to Edo Castle. The site is now the head office of the Ministry of Justice (Japan). The domain's secondary residence (shimoyashiki) was in Azabu, and its tertiary residence (nakayashiki) was in Shirogane.\n\nWhen the Boshin War erupted in 1868, and the shogunate came to an end with the abdication of shōgun Tokugawa Yoshinobu, the Uesugi joined the \"Northern Alliance\" (Ōuetsu Reppan Dōmei), voicing their support for the embattled Aizu domain and opposing Satsuma and Chōshū domination of the new imperial government, while stating an intent to \"reconquer Japan, that the Emperor may indeed reign over it.\" The Alliance members also acknowledged their debt to Hoshina Masayuki, the first Aizu lord, who was a respected figure in many domains. After several months the Alliance was defeated, and the new Meiji government reduced the domain by 40,000 koku, and its subsidiary domain of \"Yonezawa Shinden han\" was abolished in 1869. Yonezawa Domain became Yonezawa prefecture with the abolition of the han system as a whole two years later, and was then combined with Okitama prefecture to form Yamagata prefecture.\n\nThe final daimyō of Yonezawa, Uesugi Mochinori, was later ennobled with the new kazoku peerage title of hakushaku (Count).\n\n== Genealogy ==\n\n\n== Advisors ==\nFamous advisors (karō) of the Yonezawa Domain through the course of the Edo period included Chisaka Takafusa, Irobe Matashirō, and Chisaka Takamasa.\n\n== Yonezawa Shinden Domain ==\nYonezawa Shinden Domain (米沢新田藩, Yonezawa Shinden han) was founded in 1719 for Uesugi Katsuchika, the fourth son of Uesugi Tsunanori, the 4th daimyō of Yonezawa Domain, who assigned him 10,000 koku of new rice revenues.

The word is used differently in Britain and North America with regard to the amount of detail expected: in Britain, it implies a detailed summary which can be used as a substitute for the full text; whereas in North America it implies a more basic inventory.\n\nThe term derives from a (now somewhat archaic) word meaning a list or register of any kind. Although the documents in a calendar are generally arranged in chronological order, the term has no direct relationship to a table of dates.", "mgt_few3": "In archival terminology, a \"calendar\" refers to a detailed summary of documents, often published, that serves as a substitute for the original archival records. In the British tradition, calendars are meticulously prepared to include all significant elements while omitting trivial details. They are treated as primary sources and are particularly useful when published, providing remote users access to archival contents. Notable British series of published calendars include those for medieval and early modern sources. In contrast, the North American tradition of calendars involves a more concise and chronological list of documents, serving as a finding aid rather than a comprehensive substitute for the originals. The editorial task of calendaring is considered challenging, requiring accurate summarization without distortion.", "prompt": "Your task is to summarize an article to create a Wikipedia lead section. \n- In Wikipedia, the lead section is an introduction to an article and a summary of its most important contents. \n- Apart from basic facts, significant information should not appear in the lead if it is not covered in the remainder of the article.\n\nGenerate the lead for the article titled \"Calendar (archives)\" using the article's body above with no more than 121 words. Article:\n\n\"\"\"== British tradition ==\nIn the British tradition, the word normally implies a full descriptive summary (often published) in which each document is the subject of a \"carefully controlled, rigorously consistent précis\". All significant elements in the text are recorded, so that the great majority of researchers will be spared the need to consult the originals: the completed calendar effectively becomes a substitute for the archival documents, and is often treated as a primary source in its own right. Trivial or incidental elements (\"common form and unnecessary verbiage\") are omitted; but all names, dates and significant statements are noted, and passages which appear to the editor to be of particular interest or importance may be quoted in full. Documents in archaic or foreign languages (particularly Latin) are normally calendared in the modern vernacular, but significant or ambiguous terms or passages may be given in the original language. A calendar is therefore less detailed or comprehensive than a series of full transcripts or translations; but considerably more detailed than an archival list or other finding aid.\n\nCalendars are at their most useful when published, giving remote users access to the contents of archival records. Well-known series of published calendars of British medieval and early modern sources include the Calendar of Charter Rolls (1903–1927); the Calendar of Close Rolls (1900–1963); the Calendar of Patent Rolls (1891–); the Calendars of State Papers (Domestic and Foreign) (1856–); the Calendars of Treasury Books and Papers (1868–1962) (all from material now in The National Archives); the Calendars of Entries in the Papal Registers relating to Great Britain and Ireland (published by the Public Record Office 1896–1960, and by the Irish Manuscripts Commission 1978–); the Letters and Papers of the Reign of Henry VIII (1864–1932); and the \"Reports and Calendars\" series on privately held archives published between 1869 and 2004 by the Royal Commission on Historical Manuscripts.\n\nOne advantage of calendars in the era of print publishing was that a précis of a text took up less space than a full transcript or facsimile. This reasoning carries less weight in the age of electronic publishing; but calendars still have a role in providing readers with an accurate, comprehensive and accessible summary of a document which may be more readily comprehensible than a more faithful and complete version of the original. In Irish historiography, the destruction of the Public Record Office of Ireland during the Irish Civil War means that calendars made before 1922 are often the most complete surviving records.\n\nRoy Hunnisett writes:\n\nSimilarly, Paul Harvey emphasises that the editorial task of calendaring \"is not the soft option that editors have sometimes assumed\"; and that the process of summarising accurately without error or distortion can be \"significantly harder than straightforward editing\".\n\n== North American tradition ==\nIn the North American tradition, a \"calendar\" generally implies a briefer and more summary list or inventory than in Britain, arranged chronologically. Its intention is to provide a succinct indication of the documents' date, origin and subject-matter, but little more; and it is designed as a finding aid to locate the originals, not as a substitute for them.\"\"\""}

It was built on the site of the old West End Market, which was demolished for this purpose, and the ground floor of the new building was designed as a replacement covered market space. Only the original market sign survived, moved to back of the building above the new market’s rear entrance. Although postcards with exterior views of the Alhambra Palace are plentiful, there are very few images of its interior. Fortunately, the national press published detailed descriptions at the time.\n\nFrom conception and design to financing and management the Alhambra Palace, which opened on April 4, 1901, was entirely a local effort, conceived by developers John Gardner and John Scott and young architect Herbert Howarth, all of whom lived near by. John Edmondson was the experienced local building contractor who also installed the electric lighting in the theatre. He was also responsible for most of Morecambe’s great buildings, including the surviving 1900 Park Hotel up Regent Road from the Alhambra.\n\nFor the first few years of their existence, Gardner managed the Alhambra and the Park Hotel, both integral to the partners’ redevelopment of the West End's 1877 Summer Gardens whose 30 acres, including a massive pavilion, had proved unprofitable and located too far from the sea.

By 1910 the venue was also licensed as a cinema and regularly screened films in between live theatre and variety revues.

It closed as a cinema during World War II when it was requisitioned for use in the war effort, and reopened in 1946.\n\nThe venue was closed in 1970, when a projector caught fire in the upper tiers and the entire wood structure of the interior collapsed, although the flames did not spread to the large space of fly tower. The walls and main structure were unaffected by the internal damage, and so, after basic remodelling inside (the suspended ceilings still conceal a cavernous balcony and roof space above), it reopened as the Carleton Club, a huge 'black box' with multi-bars suited to dance and social events. Various restaurants also occupied the front part of the original theatre floor, where ceiling to floor bay windows directly look out on Morecambe Bay.\n\nThe club's fortunes faded at exactly the same time that Morecambe's West End became a particular area of major social deprivation as a result of the whole resort's economy collapsing in the 1980s and 1990s.

Article:\n\n\"\"\"== History ==\nOn 12 January 1838, Thomas Lucas established The London Society for Teaching the Blind to Read in the city of London, where he introduced his Lucas Type, an early form of embossed text.\n\nFunds for the school were raised largely through the efforts of the Ladies' Committee under the secretaryship of Mrs Lydia Johnson. Her husband, Percival Norton Johnson, founder of what is now Johnson Matthey plc, also took a prominent role in the affairs of the Society for many years.\n\nOver the years the school slowly expanded, moving to locations across London, before heading to Aylesbury during World War II and eventually Seal in Kent. A college and nursery were later established to allow RLSB to reach out to more young people.\n\nTo help vision impaired people gain employment, RLSB also ran a home workers scheme and workshops through the 1900s to allow people to learn a trade and find work.\n\nRLSB continued evolved and expanded to meet new needs of vision impaired young people. Supporters and donors have included the Royal family, playwright J. B. Priestley and Charlie Chaplin.\n\nOn 1 January 2017, the Royal Society for Blind Children (RSBC) and Royal London Society for Blind People (RLSB) joined to create a charity in England & Wales under the name of the Royal Society for Blind Children.\n\n== Timeline ==\nThe original day school opened in Fitzroy Street, London, on 12 January 1839. In 1840, it moved to a larger premises in 6 Gloucester Place, where resident pupils were accepted. In 1842, the organisation moved to larger premises in Bloomsbury; in 1847, a purpose-built school in Swiss Cottage was completed at a cost of £4,500.\n\nIn 1938, the RLSB's 100th anniversary year, the prefix 'Royal' was added to the Society's title by order of HM King George VI; it became the 'Royal London Society for Teaching the Blind to Read'.\n\nAt the start of World War II, the children were evacuated from London to a large manor house in Buckinghamshire called 'Dorton House'.\n\nIn 1954, the Society purchased 'Wildernesse' in Seal and it became the new permanent home of the School. The name 'Dorton House' was transferred to the new property and the school was officially opened in 1956. The RLSB's purpose-built Dorton House School was opened by the Duchess of Gloucester in 1983. Costing £1.75 million to build, it was designed for the education of 140 pupils.\n\nIn 1989, the Queen opened Dorton's College of Further Education; in 1996, a purpose-built nursery was opened. In 2009, Hollybank Farm was officially opened by the Duchess of Gloucester at Dorton House Campus in Seal. In 2010, Tom Pey joined the RLSB as their chief executive officer.\n\n== Dorton College ==\nRLSB conducts an education initiative called Learning and Living with Dorton, which allows young people to continue their education in a semi-independent living environment, accessing a post 16 curriculum in a nearby mainstream college, augmented with specialist support. Students live in one of RLSB's community houses in London and the south-east.\n\nRLSB partners with local further education colleges to support students to access a wider range of courses, combined with elements of RLSB's JIGSAW Curriculum (a skills for independent living curriculum) in their community living setting.\n\n== RLSB Connections ==\nRLSB runs a network for blind and partially sighted young people called RLSB Connections, through which they can access a range of opportunities.\n\nWorking across all London Boroughs, RLSB provides support people who are blind or partially sighted find employment. The organisation also works with employed people who have concerns over their deteriorating eyesight, helping them continue to work in an effective manner, as well as identifying employment opportunities for clients and provide training and support services to help employers better meet the needs of their blind and partially sighted employees and customers.\n\nRLSB maintains a programme called Sport Without Limits, intended to give visually impaired young people aged 8–25 the chance to experience a range of sporting activities including cricket, football, tennis, goalball, athletics, judo and even rock climbing. The programme features activity days that take place across London, Kent and Sussex.\n\nRLSB also works with teachers and teaching assistants in mainstream education, attempting to equip them with the skills they need to work with blind and visually impaired young people\"\"\""}

However, he fractured his tibia a day later, (blocking a shot by Adrian Aucoin) during an exhibition game, which would result in missing 38 games. He returned during the mid-season, only to be injured again with a broken left leg, on February 25. Moreau had struggled with injuries during the 2006–07 and 2007–08 seasons and managed to play only 32 games, between these two seasons.\n\nMoreau was also the last remaining asset that the Oilers retained, as a result of the Wayne Gretzky trade — taking all subsequent trades into account. He was also one of the longest-serving Oiler players in recent history, having been a member of the team from March 20, 1999, until June 30, 2010.\n\nOn January 18, 2009, Moreau scored his first career hat-trick in a 6-3 victory over the Phoenix Coyotes.\n\nDuring a game against the Minnesota Wild, in Edmonton, on February 28, 2009, Moreau suffered an eye injury. Antti Miettinen of the Wild caught Moreau with a high stick, sending him sprawling to the ice. Doctors at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Edmonton concluded that he suffered a scratched cornea and bleeding behind the eye.\n\nOn June 18, 2009, Ethan Moreau was awarded the King Clancy Memorial Trophy for best exemplifying leadership qualities on and off the ice and by also making significant humanitarian contributions to the Oilers Community Foundation.\n\nOn June 30, 2010, Moreau was claimed off waivers by the Columbus Blue Jackets. The Oilers were intending to buy out the final year of his contract had he gone unclaimed.\n\nOn August 20, 2011, he signed a one-year contract with the Los Angeles Kings for $600,000.\n\n== Retirement ==\nOn June 20, 2012, following the Kings' Stanley Cup Championship, Moreau joined the Montreal Canadiens' scouting staff as professional scout for the Western Conference.\n\n== Coaching ==\nIn 2016, he joined as the Niagara Purple Eagles men's ice hockey team as assistant coach of Dave Burkholder.\"\"\""}

Harrows play a crucial role in soil preparation and cultivation practices in agriculture.", "prompt": "Your task is to summarize an article to create a Wikipedia lead section. \n- In Wikipedia, the lead section is an introduction to an article and a summary of its most important contents. \n- Apart from basic facts, significant information should not appear in the lead if it is not covered in the remainder of the article.\n\nGenerate the lead for the article titled \"Harrow (tool)\" using the article's body above with no more than 206 words. Article:\n\n\"\"\"== Harrow action ==\nIn modern mechanized farming, generally a farmer will use two harrows, one after the other. The disk harrow is used first to slice up the large clods left by the mould-board plough, followed by the spring-tooth harrow. To save time and fuel they may be pulled by one tractor; the disk hitched to the tractor, and the spring-tooth hitched to, and directly behind, the disk. The result is a smooth field with powdery dirt at the surface.\n\n== Types ==\nIn cooler climates the most common types are the disc harrow, the chain harrow, the tine harrow or spike harrow and the spring tine harrow. Chain harrows are often used for lighter work such as levelling the tilth or covering seed, while disc harrows are typically used for heavy work, such as following ploughing to break up the sod. In addition, there are various types of power harrow, in which the cultivators are power-driven from the tractor rather than depending on its forward motion.\n\nTine harrows are used to refine seed-bed condition before planting, to remove small weeds in growing crops and to loosen the inter-row soils to allow for water to soak into the subsoil. The fourth is a chain disk harrow. Disk attached to chains are pulled at an angle over the ground. These harrows move rapidly across the surface. The chain and disk rotate to stay clean while breaking up the top surface to about 1 inch (3 cm) deep. A smooth seedbed is prepared for planting with one pass.\n\nChain harrowing can be used on pasture land to spread out dung, and to break up dead material (thatch) in the sward, and similarly in sports-ground maintenance a light chain harrowing is often used to level off the ground after heavy use, to remove and smooth out boot marks and indentations. Used on tilled land in combination with the other two types, chain harrowing rolls remaining larger soil clumps to the surface where weather breaks them down and prevents interference with seed germination.\n\nAll four harrow types can be used in one pass to prepare soil for seeding. It is also common to use any combination of two harrows for a variety of tilling processes. Where harrowing provides a very fine tilth, or the soil is very light so that it might easily be wind-blown, a roller is often added as the last of the set.\n\nHarrows may be of several types and weights, depending on their purpose. They almost always consist of a rigid frame that holds discs, teeth, linked chains, or other means of moving soil—but tine and chain harrows are often only supported by a rigid towing-bar at the front of the set.\n\nIn the southern hemisphere, so-called giant discs are a specialised kind of disc harrows that can stand in for a plough in rough country where a mouldboard plough cannot handle tree-stumps and rocks, and a disc-plough is too slow (because of its limited number of discs). Giant scalloped-edged discs operate in a set, or frame, that is often weighted with concrete or steel blocks to improve penetration of the cutting edges. This sort of cultivation is usually followed by broadcast fertilisation and seeding, rather than drilled or row seeding.\n\nA drag is a heavy harrow.\n\n== Power harrow ==\nA rotary power harrow, or simply power harrow, has multiple sets of vertical tines. Each set of tines is rotated on a vertical axis and tills the soil horizontally. The result is that, unlike a rotary tiller, soil layers are not turned over or inverted, which is useful in preventing dormant weed seeds from being brought to the surface, and there is no horizontal slicing of the subsurface soil that can lead to hardpan formation.\n\n== Historical reference ==\nIn Europe, harrows were used in antiquity and the Middle Ages. The oldest known illustration of a harrow is in Scene 10 of the eleventh-century Bayeux Tapestry. An Arabic reference to harrows is to be found in Abu Bakr Ibn Wahshiyya's Nabatean Agriculture (Kitab al-Filaha al-Nabatiyya), of the 10th century, but claiming knowledge from Babylonian sources.\"\"\""}

It is a burial ground of the Copper Culture Indians. This burial ground is considered to be the oldest cemetery in Wisconsin and one of the oldest in the nation. The Ho-Chunk believe that they were created on the shores of Green Bay at a place called Red Banks.\n\nThe French Jesuit, Roman Catholic priest, and missionary, Father Claude-Jean Allouez said the first Mass in Oconto on December 3, 1669.\n\nThe bay was named la baie des Puants (literally, \"the bay of the Stinks\") by the French explorer Jean Nicolet as shown on many French maps of the 17th and 18th centuries. According to George R. Stewart, the French received the name from their Indian guides, who called the natives living near Green Bay by a derogatory word meaning \"Stinkers\", thus the bay was the \"Bay of the Stinkers\", but this name perplexed the French, and Jacques Marquette thought the name might relate to the smell of the swamps when he explored the area in May 1673. His fellow explorer Louis Joliet, with two canoes and five voyageurs of French-Indian ancestry (Métis) were on their way to find the Mississippi River. They travelled up the Fox River, nearly to its headwaters. The French also called the bay Baie Verte, and the English kept this name as Green Bay. The name of the bay in the Menominee language is Pūcīhkit, or \"bay that smells like something rotting\".\n\nIn 1671 and 1673, Louis André and Jacques Marquette described fluctuations in the water level of the bay and discussed what they thought caused them.\n\n== Ferromanganese nodules, currents, reefs, and fish ==\nFerromanganese nodules have been found in the bay. Todorokite occurs within the nodules.\n\nThere are numerous reefs of exposed bedrock in the Porte des Mortes passage and in the bay.\n\nNorth of the peninsula, warm water from Green Bay flows into Lake Michigan on the surface, while at the same time, cold lakewater enters Green Bay deep underneath.\n\nIn a study looking at the contents' of fish stomachs, walleye were found to each between 5-6% and lake whitefish and yellow perch over the course of a year. However, south of Chambers Island, walleye eat considerably more lake whitefish in May and June. Walleye were found to eat more yellow perch on an annual basis, but not more than 15% of their overall diet during any particular month.\n\nWalleye and Lake whitefish in Green Bay for the most part do not compete for the same prey, especially south of Chambers Island. Lake whitefish and yellow perch in the bay compete strongly for the same prey south of Chambers Island, and compete moderately north of it.\n\n== Areas of concern ==\nAccording to the Environmental Protection Agency, \"Areas of Concern are designated by the International Joint Commission as geographic areas in the Great Lakes basin having severe environmental degradation. There are 43 Areas of Concern with 26 in the United States, 17 in Canada, and five shared by the two countries.\" [1][2]\n\n== Background ==\nLower green Bay Area of Concern was designated in 1987 under the Great Lakes Water Quality agreement.\n\nIt was designated by these sources of pollution:\n\nThe seasonal dead zone in the lower part of the bay may have gotten longer from 2009-2015.\n\n== Beneficial Use Impairments ==\nBeneficial Use Impairments (BUI) are a change in the chemical, physical or biological integrity of the Great Lakes system sufficient to cause significant environmental degradation. The International Joint Commission identified 14 BUIs listed below. All BUIs that have been designated for an AOC, must be removed for the AOC to be considered restored and begin the delisting process.[3]\n\n== Timeline of restoration ==\nSince 1988 over three quarters of the 120 remedial actions recommended by the lower green bay remedial action plan have been implemented or initiated.\n\nIndustrialization was a major factor regarding the Lower Green Bay becoming contaminated; significant contributors were land water use (agriculture, logging, industry), high turbidity, sedimentation, frequent algal blooms, degraded fish/wildlife/plant populations and adverse toxicant impacts.\n\n== Cleanup ==\nPast Emergency Clean Up: In 1999 and 2000, EPA oversaw a dredging project done by some of the paper companies about 3 miles upstream from the mouth of the Lower Fox River. It removed 80,000 cubic yards of PCB-contaminated sediment, containing 3,400 pounds of PCBs.\n\n2019 marks the 16th year of clean up of the lower Green Bay. River clean up is scheduled for late March depending on ice conditions. Monitoring will continue to study fish, water, and PCB concentrations. [4] Once the lower Green Bay clean up is complete long term monitoring will still be done on the entirety of the river.\"\"\""}

{"id": 16127, "revid": "1121726990", "src_inf": "== Rice paper plant ==\nIn Europe, around the 1900s, a paperlike substance was originally known as rice paper, due to the mistaken notion that it is made from rice. In fact, it consists of the pith of a small tree, Tetrapanax papyrifer, the rice paper plant (蓪草).\n\nThe plant grows in the swampy forests of Taiwan, and is also cultivated as an ornamental plant for its large, exotic leaves. In order to produce the paper, the boughs are boiled and freed from bark. The cylindrical core of pith is rolled on a hard flat surface against a knife, by which it is cut into thin sheets of a fine ivory-like texture.\n\nDyed in various colours, this rice paper is extensively used for the preparation of artificial flowers, while the white sheets are employed for watercolor drawings. Due to its texture, this paper is not suited for writing.\n\n== Mulberry paper ==\nThis \"rice paper\", smooth, thin, crackly, and strong, is named as a wrapper for rice, and is made from bark fibres of the paper mulberry tree. It is used for origami, calligraphy, paper screens and clothing. It is stronger than commercially made wood-pulp paper. Less commonly, the paper is made from rice straw.\n\nDepending on the type of mulberry used, it is named kozo (Broussonetia papyrifera, the paper mulberry), gampi (Wikstroemia diplomorpha), or mitsumata (Edgeworthia chrysantha). The fiber comes from the bark of the paper mulberry, not the inner wood or pith, and traditionally the paper is made by hand.\n\nThe branches of the paper mulberry shrubs are harvested in the autumn, so the fibre can be processed and the paper formed during the cold winter months, because the fibre spoils easily in the heat. The branches are cut into sections two to three feet long and steamed in a large kettle, which makes the bark shrink back from the inner wood, allowing it to be pulled off like a banana peel. The bark can then be dried and stored, or used immediately. There are three layers to the bark at this stage: black bark, the outermost layer; green bark, the middle layer; and white bark, the innermost layer.

By 1830, Denmark, France, Portugal, Sardinia, Spain, Sweden, Tuscany, the United Kingdom, and the United States all had consulates in Tangier.: 68 In 1856, its role as Morocco's diplomatic capital was made official, and the existing consulates were elevated to legations.: 17\n\nTangier's unique governance took further shape around 1880. That year, it was granted a monopoly of importation of tobacco and opium into Morocco. In 1879, a Dahir (decree) of the Sultan of Morocco established a Hygiene Commission, which was actually established in 1884 and further organised in 1892. The Commission was chaired by the foreign consuls, on three-months turns with succession based on alphabetical order of nationality.: 78 One of them, the Greek-American Ion Perdicaris, in 1887 advocated a special status for Tangier as a neutral free port under the great powers' joint control.: 110 In 1893, the Commission's role was broadened to public roads, with authority to raise levies.: 11\n\nIn 1904, Tangier was chosen as location of the French-led Moroccan Debt Administration. The Algeciras Conference of 1906 prepared the ground for the colonisation of Morocco and specifically for the creation of the State Bank of Morocco which would be established in Tangier the following year; it did not, however, define the status of Tangier itself. Both France and Spain wanted to control the city, and the United Kingdom wanted to neutralise it to maintain its dominance of the Strait of Gibraltar. In 1912, Article 7 of the Treaty Between France and Spain Regarding Morocco stipulated that Tangier would be granted a special status. An agreement to that effect was signed in Madrid in 1914, but its implementation was suspended by World War I.: 17 Negotiations restarted after the end of the war, in Cannes in 1922.: 12 Meanwhile, Tangier still operated under the ancient regime of Capitulations under which the Sultan of Morocco delegated wide administrative duties in the town to the foreign consulates established there.\n\n== Establishment and history ==\nEventually, France, Spain and the UK reached agreement on the Tangier Protocol on 18 December 1923.: 12 Tangier was made a neutral zone under a joint administration. In line with UK wishes, it was entirely free from any military presence. It was also made into a tax haven, with no tariffs on imported or exported goods or gold, no exchange controls, no income or revenue taxes, and unlimited freedom of establishment.: 18 Although misgivings remained about the agreement, ratifications were exchanged in Paris on 14 May 1924. The convention was amended on 25 July 1928, when the governments of Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Sweden joined the international framework.\n\nThe initial economic effect of the creation of the zone was sharply negative, because the Spanish protectorate authorities discouraged commerce with it and thus Tangier lost most of its traditional hinterland. Tangier had handled nineteen percent of Morocco's imports in 1906, but only four percent in 1929. With time, however, the service activities favoured by the zone's special status enabled a gradual recovery. The Zone had a reputation for tolerance, diversity of culture, religion, and bohemianism. It became a tourist hotspot for literary giants and gay men from Western countries. Many of the latter were able to live an openly \"out\" life in the Zone.\n\nSpanish troops occupied Tangier on 14 June 1940, the same day Paris fell to the Germans. Despite calls by the writer Rafael Sánchez Mazas and other Spanish nationalists to annex \"Tánger español\", the Francoist State publicly considered the occupation a temporary wartime measure. A diplomatic dispute between Britain and Spain over the latter's abolition of the city's international institutions in November 1940 led to a further guarantee of British rights and a Spanish promise not to fortify the area. Tangiers was annexed to the Spanish Protectorate of Morocco on 23 November 1940. In May 1944, although it had served as a contact point between himself and the later Axis Powers during the Spanish Civil War, Franco expelled all German diplomats from the Zone.\n\nThe territory was restored to its pre-war status on 11 October 1945. The activity of Tangier as an offshore financial centre and tax haven took off in the postwar period. In 1950, there were 85 banks in Tangier, up from 4 in 1900 and 15 in 1939.: 18 Its practice of banking secrecy was extreme, with effectively no bank licensing, no prudential supervision, no accounting obligations, and no transparency whatsoever about a bank's ownership. In some cases, the senior management of a Tangier bank would not even know who the bank's owners were. One author wrote that \"the authorities of Tangier had pushed to an unequaled degree of perfection the art of non-governing by reciprocal annulment of rival sovereignties. They took care, better than elsewhere, of the rigorous application of an almost total non-taxation\".: 113 In July 1952 the protecting powers met at Rabat to discuss the Zone's future, agreeing to abolish it. Tangier joined with the rest of Morocco following the restoration of full sovereignty in 1956. At the time of the handover, Tangier had a population of around 40,000 Muslims; 31,000 Christians; and 15,000 Jews.\n\nOn 29 October 1956, the foreign nations involved in the zone and the Moroccan government, represented by Foreign Minister Ahmed Balafrej, signed a joint declaration that returned Tangier to full Moroccan sovereignty. Mohammed V granted it a charter to smooth the transition and extend its tax and other privileges on a temporary basis. In October 1959, that charter was abrogated with a six-month notice period.: 22 The expiration of that transition on 11 April 1960 marked the final end of Tangier's special status.\n\n== Executive ==\nExecutive power was vested in an Administrator. In the interwar period all Administrators were French, until the Spanish takeover of June 1940. They had two deputies, one French and one British.: 18 After the re-establishment of the international regime in 1945, the Administrators were from other nationalities, namely Portuguese (1945–1948 and 1951–1954), Dutch (1948–1951), and Belgian (1954–1956).\n\nIn the zone's early years and until 1937, the Administrator and his staff worked in the building of the Moroccan Debt Administration, on Boulevard Pasteur. From 1937 to the Spanish takeover, they appear to have been located at the nearby French Consulate. A new building constructed to house the International Administration was completed in the early 1950s. After Moroccan independence, that building was repurposed as the seat of the local Prefecture (Wilaya), now of the region of Tanger-Tetouan-Al Hoceima.\n\nThe zone's Muslim and Jewish communities were not directly administered by the foreign nations but by a personal representative of the Sultan, the Mendoub. The Mendoub had his seat and main residence in the former German consulate, now known as the Mendoubia. From 1929 he also had a secondary residence in the Marshan neighbourhood, also known as the Mendoub Palace, now part of Marshan Palace.\n\n== Legislature ==\nThe zone's legislature was the International Legislative Assembly, which was subject to supervision by a Committee of Control consisting of the Consuls of Belgium, France, Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain, with rotating chair similarly as in the former Hygiene Commission. The assembly's 26-strong membership was set as follows: 4 French, 4 Spanish, 3 British, 3 Italians, 1 Belgian, 1 Dutch, 1 Portuguese, 6 Muslims, and 3 Jews.: 8\n\nAfter World War II, a new home was built for the Legislative Assembly,: 18 which is now the main building of Marshan Palace.\n\n== Judiciary ==\nJudicial power resided in a Mixed Court of five judges, respectively appointed by the Belgian, British, Spanish, French, and Italian governments. As a result of the creation of the Mixed Court, the various European powers withdrew the consular courts that previously exercised jurisdiction there. From its start, the Mixed Court was considered a unique experiment given its international setup. Unlike other institutions of the zone, it continued to function under the Spanish occupation of Tangier during World War II. It was reformed in 1952 but remained affected by shortcomings that included inadequate representation of Muslim Moroccans and an insufficient number of judges. Its activity ceased in 1957.\n\nThe Mixed Court was initially located together with the International Administration on Boulevard Pasteur. In 1937, it moved to purpose-built art deco courthouse on rue Washington (now avenue Omar Ibn Al Khattab), which after Moroccan independence became the city courthouse (Template:Lang-fr). In 2021 the court moved to a new building in the outskirts of Tangier.", "src": "== Background ==\nTangier had developed since the 18th century as the main point of contact between the Moroccan monarchy and European commercial interests, leading to the establishment of a number of consulates in the city by the main European nations.

By 1830, Denmark, France, Portugal, Sardinia, Spain, Sweden, Tuscany, the United Kingdom, and the United States all had consulates in Tangier.: 68 In 1856, its role as Morocco's diplomatic capital was made official, and the existing consulates were elevated to legations.: 17\n\nTangier's unique governance took further shape around 1880. That year, it was granted a monopoly of importation of tobacco and opium into Morocco. In 1879, a Dahir (decree) of the Sultan of Morocco established a Hygiene Commission, which was actually established in 1884 and further organised in 1892. The Commission was chaired by the foreign consuls, on three-months turns with succession based on alphabetical order of nationality.: 78 One of them, the Greek-American Ion Perdicaris, in 1887 advocated a special status for Tangier as a neutral free port under the great powers' joint control.: 110 In 1893, the Commission's role was broadened to public roads, with authority to raise levies.: 11\n\nIn 1904, Tangier was chosen as location of the French-led Moroccan Debt Administration. The Algeciras Conference of 1906 prepared the ground for the colonisation of Morocco and specifically for the creation of the State Bank of Morocco which would be established in Tangier the following year; it did not, however, define the status of Tangier itself. Both France and Spain wanted to control the city, and the United Kingdom wanted to neutralise it to maintain its dominance of the Strait of Gibraltar. In 1912, Article 7 of the Treaty Between France and Spain Regarding Morocco stipulated that Tangier would be granted a special status. An agreement to that effect was signed in Madrid in 1914, but its implementation was suspended by World War I.: 17 Negotiations restarted after the end of the war, in Cannes in 1922.: 12 Meanwhile, Tangier still operated under the ancient regime of Capitulations under which the Sultan of Morocco delegated wide administrative duties in the town to the foreign consulates established there.\n\n== Establishment and history ==\nEventually, France, Spain and the UK reached agreement on the Tangier Protocol on 18 December 1923.: 12 Tangier was made a neutral zone under a joint administration. In line with UK wishes, it was entirely free from any military presence. It was also made into a tax haven, with no tariffs on imported or exported goods or gold, no exchange controls, no income or revenue taxes, and unlimited freedom of establishment.: 18 Although misgivings remained about the agreement, ratifications were exchanged in Paris on 14 May 1924. The convention was amended on 25 July 1928, when the governments of Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Sweden joined the international framework.\n\nThe initial economic effect of the creation of the zone was sharply negative, because the Spanish protectorate authorities discouraged commerce with it and thus Tangier lost most of its traditional hinterland. Tangier had handled nineteen percent of Morocco's imports in 1906, but only four percent in 1929. With time, however, the service activities favoured by the zone's special status enabled a gradual recovery. The Zone had a reputation for tolerance, diversity of culture, religion, and bohemianism. It became a tourist hotspot for literary giants and gay men from Western countries. Many of the latter were able to live an openly \"out\" life in the Zone.\n\nSpanish troops occupied Tangier on 14 June 1940, the same day Paris fell to the Germans. Despite calls by the writer Rafael Sánchez Mazas and other Spanish nationalists to annex \"Tánger español\", the Francoist State publicly considered the occupation a temporary wartime measure. A diplomatic dispute between Britain and Spain over the latter's abolition of the city's international institutions in November 1940 led to a further guarantee of British rights and a Spanish promise not to fortify the area. Tangiers was annexed to the Spanish Protectorate of Morocco on 23 November 1940. In May 1944, although it had served as a contact point between himself and the later Axis Powers during the Spanish Civil War, Franco expelled all German diplomats from the Zone.\n\nThe territory was restored to its pre-war status on 11 October 1945. The activity of Tangier as an offshore financial centre and tax haven took off in the postwar period. In 1950, there were 85 banks in Tangier, up from 4 in 1900 and 15 in 1939.: 18 Its practice of banking secrecy was extreme, with effectively no bank licensing, no prudential supervision, no accounting obligations, and no transparency whatsoever about a bank's ownership. In some cases, the senior management of a Tangier bank would not even know who the bank's owners were. One author wrote that \"the authorities of Tangier had pushed to an unequaled degree of perfection the art of non-governing by reciprocal annulment of rival sovereignties. They took care, better than elsewhere, of the rigorous application of an almost total non-taxation\".: 113 In July 1952 the protecting powers met at Rabat to discuss the Zone's future, agreeing to abolish it. Tangier joined with the rest of Morocco following the restoration of full sovereignty in 1956. At the time of the handover, Tangier had a population of around 40,000 Muslims; 31,000 Christians; and 15,000 Jews.\n\nOn 29 October 1956, the foreign nations involved in the zone and the Moroccan government, represented by Foreign Minister Ahmed Balafrej, signed a joint declaration that returned Tangier to full Moroccan sovereignty. Mohammed V granted it a charter to smooth the transition and extend its tax and other privileges on a temporary basis. In October 1959, that charter was abrogated with a six-month notice period.: 22 The expiration of that transition on 11 April 1960 marked the final end of Tangier's special status.\n\n== Executive ==\nExecutive power was vested in an Administrator. In the interwar period all Administrators were French, until the Spanish takeover of June 1940. They had two deputies, one French and one British.: 18 After the re-establishment of the international regime in 1945, the Administrators were from other nationalities, namely Portuguese (1945–1948 and 1951–1954), Dutch (1948–1951), and Belgian (1954–1956).\n\nIn the zone's early years and until 1937, the Administrator and his staff worked in the building of the Moroccan Debt Administration, on Boulevard Pasteur. From 1937 to the Spanish takeover, they appear to have been located at the nearby French Consulate. A new building constructed to house the International Administration was completed in the early 1950s. After Moroccan independence, that building was repurposed as the seat of the local Prefecture (Wilaya), now of the region of Tanger-Tetouan-Al Hoceima.\n\nThe zone's Muslim and Jewish communities were not directly administered by the foreign nations but by a personal representative of the Sultan, the Mendoub. The Mendoub had his seat and main residence in the former German consulate, now known as the Mendoubia. From 1929 he also had a secondary residence in the Marshan neighbourhood, also known as the Mendoub Palace, now part of Marshan Palace.\n\n== Legislature ==\nThe zone's legislature was the International Legislative Assembly, which was subject to supervision by a Committee of Control consisting of the Consuls of Belgium, France, Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain, with rotating chair similarly as in the former Hygiene Commission.

Its existence was virtually unknown to the British until fragments of one torpedo were recovered following the sinking of the Royal Oak in October 1939. The advantages of the G7e in contrast to the G7a wet-heater steam-driven torpedo rested in its simplicity and cheapness of manufacture (half the cost), as well as being virtually silent and leaving almost no visible trail of air bubbles to alert ships that they were under attack. However, in all other respects, the TII was less reliable and performed unpredictably compared to the G7a(TI), with shorter range of 5,000 m (5,500 yd) and slower speed at 56 km/h (30 kn). Additionally, the batteries of these torpedoes needed to be preheated to a temperature of 30 °C (86 °F) to operate with maximum speed and range, though generally this was not a problem since U-boats had the element of surprise and often had the advantage of firing the first shot.\n\nPoor range and speed were not the TII's only problems. Both the contact and magnetic detonators were unreliable, major flaws that also afflicted the United States Navy's standard Mark 14 anti-submarine and anti-ship torpedo. The magnetic influence exploder, designed to allow the torpedo to run under the keel of a ship and detonate, breaking the ship's back, was inconsistent and would often detonate prematurely, or not at all. This led the BdU to order that all G7e(TII) torpedoes be fired only for contact detonation. However, the contact pistol of the TII also proved to be unreliable; the British battleship HMS Nelson managed to survive almost certain destruction when three torpedoes from U-56 struck on her keel, two broke upon hitting and the other failed to explode.\n\nThese technical defects led to the circumstance that attacks on at least one battleship, seven heavy cruisers, seven destroyers and some cargo ships were not successful.\n\nNevertheless, the German Navy, after much prodding by German U-boat Command (BdU), invested resources into correcting the TII's flaws. Gradually, it improved, and by the end of the Norwegian Campaign problems with the contact exploder and depth-keeping gear had been mostly solved, with significant strides made in improving the magnetic proximity feature. At the same time, the TII's range was increased from 5,000 to 7,500 m (5,500 to 8,200 yd). By that time, however, the TII was already being phased out of production.\n\n== G7e(TIII) ==\nImprovements in the design of the G7e(TII) were incorporated into the production of the next model of electric torpedo for Germany's U-boat fleet. Introduced in 1942, the TIII represented a vast improvement over the early TII. The faulty exploders from the TII were scrapped in favor of a new design.\n\nThe TIII had a range of 7,500 m (8,200 yd) and could achieve 56 km/h (30 kn). With the improved design the TIII complemented the G7a(TI) wet-heater torpedo, which was only used at night for the rest of the war (it remained the only torpedo used by surface ships though), and the TIII was used for day-attacks. Using the TIII's perfected proximity feature, U-boat captains could effectively fire under the keel of a ship and break the back of their targets with a single torpedo, increasing the overall effectiveness of the U-boat fleet. The TIII was also issued with program steering FaT (Flächenabsuchender Torpedo) - - G7e(TIII Fat II) - and LuT (Lagenunabhängiger Torpedo) - G7e(TIII Lut II) - pattern running systems for convoy attacks.\n\nThough many opportunities had been missed due to the defects of the TII torpedo, with the new TIII U-boats were deadlier than ever.\n\n== G7es(TIV) Falke ==\nThe TIV Model was the adjunct of the earlier TIII model in nearly every way. The TIV was not an ordinary straight-running torpedo, it ran at 37 km/h (20 kn) for 7,500 m (8,200 yd) and was the world's first operational acoustic homing torpedo, since it was introduced in March 1943, the same month and year as the American Mk-24 \"Mine\" acoustic homing torpedo.\n\nEarly in 1933 Germany started development and testing of acoustic homing mechanisms for torpedoes. From the outset of submarine warfare, submariners had dreamed of being able to aim and fire torpedoes without surfacing or using a periscope. The periscope gives away the location of a submarine, and a hull-penetrating periscope greatly weakens a submarine's pressure hull and limits the depths to which it can dive. U-boats also had to come to very shallow depths to use their periscopes, generally about 15 m (50 ft), leaving them greatly exposed to bombing, depth charging, and even gunfire.\n\nWith the introduction of Falke, U-boats could remain more deeply submerged and fire at convoys with nothing to give away their position but the noise of their screws. Rather than aiming with a periscope, the torpedo could be roughly aimed at a sound contact as detected by a U-boat's hydrophones, and the homing mechanism could be trusted to find the target without the need for precise aiming.\n\nFalke worked much like a normal straight-running torpedo for the first 400 m (440 yd) of its run, after which its acoustic sensors became active and searched for a target. The sensitive sound-sensing equipment in Falke required the torpedo be as quiet as possible, hence it ran at only 37 km/h (20 kn); in addition, the firing U-boat was forced to stop its motors. Falke was intended to home on merchant targets, however, so its slow speed was not a great hindrance.\n\nOnly known to have been fired in action by three U-boats, U-221, U-603 and U-758, although regarded as successful, resulting in the sinking of several merchants, and its performance rated satisfactory, Falke was rapidly phased out of service. It was replaced by the G7es(TV) \"Zaunkönig\" (referred to by the Allies as GNAT, for German Navy Acoustic Torpedo), which was faster and better able to home onto the sound of fast moving warships as well as merchant traffic.\n\nThough its period of operational service was brief, Falke was a proof of concept for the acoustic homing torpedo. Its introduction occurred only two months before the U.S. Navy achieved its initial combat success with the Mark 24 FIDO \"mine.\" FIDO was not a mine, but a passive, acoustic-homing torpedo designed for use by long-range patrol aircraft. The initial success with the Mark 24 occurred on 14 May 1943, when a PBY-5 from VP-84 sank U-640 with the new weapon. Most sources indicate that the Germans' first combat success with the Zaunkönig (GNAT) did not occur until September 1943. While the Allies became aware in September 1943 that the Germans had brought GNAT into operational service, it was not until the capture of U-505 in June 1944 that they obtained reliable data on the German homing torpedo.", "src": "== G7e(TII) ==\nThe G7e(TII) went in service with German U-boat fleets in 1936.

Rather than aiming with a periscope, the torpedo could be roughly aimed at a sound contact as detected by a U-boat's hydrophones, and the homing mechanism could be trusted to find the target without the need for precise aiming.\n\nFalke worked much like a normal straight-running torpedo for the first 400 m (440 yd) of its run, after which its acoustic sensors became active and searched for a target. The sensitive sound-sensing equipment in Falke required the torpedo be as quiet as possible, hence it ran at only 37 km/h (20 kn); in addition, the firing U-boat was forced to stop its motors. Falke was intended to home on merchant targets, however, so its slow speed was not a great hindrance.\n\nOnly known to have been fired in action by three U-boats, U-221, U-603 and U-758, although regarded as successful, resulting in the sinking of several merchants, and its performance rated satisfactory, Falke was rapidly phased out of service.

Its existence was virtually unknown to the British until fragments of one torpedo were recovered following the sinking of the Royal Oak in October 1939. The advantages of the G7e in contrast to the G7a wet-heater steam-driven torpedo rested in its simplicity and cheapness of manufacture (half the cost), as well as being virtually silent and leaving almost no visible trail of air bubbles to alert ships that they were under attack. However, in all other respects, the TII was less reliable and performed unpredictably compared to the G7a(TI), with shorter range of 5,000 m (5,500 yd) and slower speed at 56 km/h (30 kn). Additionally, the batteries of these torpedoes needed to be preheated to a temperature of 30 °C (86 °F) to operate with maximum speed and range, though generally this was not a problem since U-boats had the element of surprise and often had the advantage of firing the first shot.\n\nPoor range and speed were not the TII's only problems. Both the contact and magnetic detonators were unreliable, major flaws that also afflicted the United States Navy's standard Mark 14 anti-submarine and anti-ship torpedo. The magnetic influence exploder, designed to allow the torpedo to run under the keel of a ship and detonate, breaking the ship's back, was inconsistent and would often detonate prematurely, or not at all. This led the BdU to order that all G7e(TII) torpedoes be fired only for contact detonation. However, the contact pistol of the TII also proved to be unreliable; the British battleship HMS Nelson managed to survive almost certain destruction when three torpedoes from U-56 struck on her keel, two broke upon hitting and the other failed to explode.\n\nThese technical defects led to the circumstance that attacks on at least one battleship, seven heavy cruisers, seven destroyers and some cargo ships were not successful.\n\nNevertheless, the German Navy, after much prodding by German U-boat Command (BdU), invested resources into correcting the TII's flaws. Gradually, it improved, and by the end of the Norwegian Campaign problems with the contact exploder and depth-keeping gear had been mostly solved, with significant strides made in improving the magnetic proximity feature. At the same time, the TII's range was increased from 5,000 to 7,500 m (5,500 to 8,200 yd). By that time, however, the TII was already being phased out of production.\n\n== G7e(TIII) ==\nImprovements in the design of the G7e(TII) were incorporated into the production of the next model of electric torpedo for Germany's U-boat fleet. Introduced in 1942, the TIII represented a vast improvement over the early TII. The faulty exploders from the TII were scrapped in favor of a new design.\n\nThe TIII had a range of 7,500 m (8,200 yd) and could achieve 56 km/h (30 kn). With the improved design the TIII complemented the G7a(TI) wet-heater torpedo, which was only used at night for the rest of the war (it remained the only torpedo used by surface ships though), and the TIII was used for day-attacks. Using the TIII's perfected proximity feature, U-boat captains could effectively fire under the keel of a ship and break the back of their targets with a single torpedo, increasing the overall effectiveness of the U-boat fleet. The TIII was also issued with program steering FaT (Flächenabsuchender Torpedo) - - G7e(TIII Fat II) - and LuT (Lagenunabhängiger Torpedo) - G7e(TIII Lut II) - pattern running systems for convoy attacks.\n\nThough many opportunities had been missed due to the defects of the TII torpedo, with the new TIII U-boats were deadlier than ever.\n\n== G7es(TIV) Falke ==\nThe TIV Model was the adjunct of the earlier TIII model in nearly every way. The TIV was not an ordinary straight-running torpedo, it ran at 37 km/h (20 kn) for 7,500 m (8,200 yd) and was the world's first operational acoustic homing torpedo, since it was introduced in March 1943, the same month and year as the American Mk-24 \"Mine\" acoustic homing torpedo.\n\nEarly in 1933 Germany started development and testing of acoustic homing mechanisms for torpedoes. From the outset of submarine warfare, submariners had dreamed of being able to aim and fire torpedoes without surfacing or using a periscope. The periscope gives away the location of a submarine, and a hull-penetrating periscope greatly weakens a submarine's pressure hull and limits the depths to which it can dive. U-boats also had to come to very shallow depths to use their periscopes, generally about 15 m (50 ft), leaving them greatly exposed to bombing, depth charging, and even gunfire.\n\nWith the introduction of Falke, U-boats could remain more deeply submerged and fire at convoys with nothing to give away their position but the noise of their screws. Rather than aiming with a periscope, the torpedo could be roughly aimed at a sound contact as detected by a U-boat's hydrophones, and the homing mechanism could be trusted to find the target without the need for precise aiming.\n\nFalke worked much like a normal straight-running torpedo for the first 400 m (440 yd) of its run, after which its acoustic sensors became active and searched for a target.

Beginning at the age of nine, he sang as a chorister at St. Paul's Cathedral initially under the direction of composer Charles King. After his voice broke he studied organ, music composition, and singing under William Savage, almoner and master of the choristers. He became a highly skilled organist and was particularly talented at extempore playing; a skill that soon attracted attention and led to his appointment as William Boyce's deputy at the Chapel Royal.\n\nDuring the mid-1750s he began appearing as a tenor soloist in London concerts. One of his earliest engagements was on 16 March 1756 in a concert of Handel's Alexander's Feast at the Great Room, Dean Street, where he was described as 'Mr Batichel'. That same year he became the conductor and harpsichordist at the Covent Garden Theatre. While there he composed incidental songs and choruses for plays and pantomime music for both Covent Garden and the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. In 1758 he became a member of the Madrigal Society and in 1761 a member of the Royal Society of Musicians. He was also a 'priviledged member' [sic] of the Noblemen and Gentlemen's Catch Club from c1762, but lost his membership twice for not attending meetings. In 1771 his glee Come bind my hair, ye wood nymphs fair won the club's gold medal.\n\nIn 1764 Battishill was appointed organist of St Clement Eastcheap, which had recently united with the parish at St Martin Orgar. Three years later he became organist at Christ Church, Newgate Street as well and served at both St Clement and Christ Church until his death in 1801. During this time he periodically gave organ concerts and he particularly became known for his performances of Handel's keyboard works. He also would still occasionally perform in concerts as a singer. He possessed an exceptional memory which was displayed in one concert where he played and sang from memory several airs from Samuel Arnold's oratorio The Prodigal Son without the sheet music, and after not hearing the work for more than 20 years.\n\nWhile working at Covent Garden, Battishill met singing actress Elizabeth Davies who had originated the role of Margery in Thomas Arne's Love in a Village. The two became romantically involved and on 19 December 1765 they married. However the marriage was unsuccessful, and Elizabeth had a publicly known affair with actor Anthony Webster, with whom she eventually moved to Ireland in 1776. Elizabeth died in Cork in October 1777. Battishill also had an affair with a woman who called herself Ann Battishill at the time of his death. They apparently lived together from about 1775 until the end of Battishill's life. Although Battishill was involved with another woman, his wife's desertion caused a deep depression from which he never recovered. He declined into alcoholism and his compositional output became minimal for the rest of his life. His alcoholism also resulted in his not being appointed organist of St Paul's on the death of John Jones in 1796.\n\nFrom 1777 on Battishill devoted himself mainly to his book collection. From the time he was a boy he was an avid reader, and throughout his life he had collected some 6000 to 7000 volumes in his personal library. He was mostly interested in theological works and the works of classical authors. In 1801 Battishill was buried in St Paul's near the grave of William Boyce in keeping with his own wishes.\n\n== Works ==\nMost of Battishill's compositions date from the period 1760–1775, and reflect his diverse employments during this time. He began his career primarily as a composer of theatre music; writing mostly incidental music for plays. He composed the music for one pantomime, The Rites of Hecate, which used a text by poet James Love. It premiered at Drury Lane on 26 December 1763. He also notably co-composed the music to the three-act opera Almena with Michael Arne, the son of Thomas Arne, which premiered in 1764 at Drury Lane. The opera was a theatrical failure, but critics of the day attributed its lack of success to dramatic faults on the part of the librettist Rolt, rather than to problems with the music. He also wrote several songs for London's pleasure gardens, of which Kate of Aberdeen is probably his best known.\n\nUpon taking his first organist post in 1764, Battishill composed chiefly church music, glees, catches, madrigals, and part-songs. He was particularly prolific in his output of Anglican chant (used for the psalms and canticles), hymns, and anthems. His anthems are considered his most exemplary work and are admired for employing rich blends in a multi-voiced arrangement. His anthems included O Lord, Look Down from Heaven and Call to Remembrance, the latter of which was sung at his own funeral and is still performed in cathedrals today. Of his glees, I Loved Thee Beautiful and Kind is probably his best known work. His chants also remain in use.", "src": "== Biography ==\nBattishill was born in London.

He possessed an exceptional memory which was displayed in one concert where he played and sang from memory several airs from Samuel Arnold's oratorio The Prodigal Son without the sheet music, and after not hearing the work for more than 20 years.\n\nWhile working at Covent Garden, Battishill met singing actress Elizabeth Davies who had originated the role of Margery in Thomas Arne's Love in a Village. The two became romantically involved and on 19 December 1765 they married. However the marriage was unsuccessful, and Elizabeth had a publicly known affair with actor Anthony Webster, with whom she eventually moved to Ireland in 1776. Elizabeth died in Cork in October 1777. Battishill also had an affair with a woman who called herself Ann Battishill at the time of his death. They apparently lived together from about 1775 until the end of Battishill's life. Although Battishill was involved with another woman, his wife's desertion caused a deep depression from which he never recovered. He declined into alcoholism and his compositional output became minimal for the rest of his life. His alcoholism also resulted in his not being appointed organist of St Paul's on the death of John Jones in 1796.\n\nFrom 1777 on Battishill devoted himself mainly to his book collection. From the time he was a boy he was an avid reader, and throughout his life he had collected some 6000 to 7000 volumes in his personal library. He was mostly interested in theological works and the works of classical authors. In 1801 Battishill was buried in St Paul's near the grave of William Boyce in keeping with his own wishes.\n\n== Works ==\nMost of Battishill's compositions date from the period 1760–1775, and reflect his diverse employments during this time. He began his career primarily as a composer of theatre music; writing mostly incidental music for plays. He composed the music for one pantomime, The Rites of Hecate, which used a text by poet James Love. It premiered at Drury Lane on 26 December 1763. He also notably co-composed the music to the three-act opera Almena with Michael Arne, the son of Thomas Arne, which premiered in 1764 at Drury Lane. The opera was a theatrical failure, but critics of the day attributed its lack of success to dramatic faults on the part of the librettist Rolt, rather than to problems with the music. He also wrote several songs for London's pleasure gardens, of which Kate of Aberdeen is probably his best known.\n\nUpon taking his first organist post in 1764, Battishill composed chiefly church music, glees, catches, madrigals, and part-songs. He was particularly prolific in his output of Anglican chant (used for the psalms and canticles), hymns, and anthems. His anthems are considered his most exemplary work and are admired for employing rich blends in a multi-voiced arrangement. His anthems included O Lord, Look Down from Heaven and Call to Remembrance, the latter of which was sung at his own funeral and is still performed in cathedrals today.

Article:\n\n\"\"\"== Biography ==\nBattishill was born in London. Beginning at the age of nine, he sang as a chorister at St. Paul's Cathedral initially under the direction of composer Charles King. After his voice broke he studied organ, music composition, and singing under William Savage, almoner and master of the choristers. He became a highly skilled organist and was particularly talented at extempore playing; a skill that soon attracted attention and led to his appointment as William Boyce's deputy at the Chapel Royal.\n\nDuring the mid-1750s he began appearing as a tenor soloist in London concerts. One of his earliest engagements was on 16 March 1756 in a concert of Handel's Alexander's Feast at the Great Room, Dean Street, where he was described as 'Mr Batichel'. That same year he became the conductor and harpsichordist at the Covent Garden Theatre. While there he composed incidental songs and choruses for plays and pantomime music for both Covent Garden and the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. In 1758 he became a member of the Madrigal Society and in 1761 a member of the Royal Society of Musicians. He was also a 'priviledged member' [sic] of the Noblemen and Gentlemen's Catch Club from c1762, but lost his membership twice for not attending meetings. In 1771 his glee Come bind my hair, ye wood nymphs fair won the club's gold medal.\n\nIn 1764 Battishill was appointed organist of St Clement Eastcheap, which had recently united with the parish at St Martin Orgar. Three years later he became organist at Christ Church, Newgate Street as well and served at both St Clement and Christ Church until his death in 1801. During this time he periodically gave organ concerts and he particularly became known for his performances of Handel's keyboard works.

A media plan sets out a systematic process that synchronizes all contributing elements in order to achieve this specific goal. The media plan is broken down into four stages; market analysis, establishment of media objectives, media strategy development and implementation, and evaluation and follow-up.\n\nSimilarities can be made to other marketing concepts such as the consumer decision-making process with comparisons such as, increasing brand awareness, improving brand image, and the maximization of customer satisfaction.\n\nThe first phase of any media plan is the initial market analysis, which consists of a situation analysis and the marketing strategy plan. These form the basis of information which the rest of the media plan is reliant on. The purpose of a situation analysis is to understand the marketing problem, in relation to their competitors. For example, undertaking an internal and external review or competitive strategy evaluation.\n\nThe marketing strategy plan should establish specific objectives and goals that will solve the marketing problems that developed. Once the market analysis is complete the improved knowledge gained should indicate a proffered target market. Enabling the marketers to understand where the prime advertising space would be to gain sufficient exposure, what factors affect that certain demographic, and how to promote to the audience effectively.\n\nThe second phase in the media plan is the establishment of media objectives. Just as the marketing analysis leads to specific marketing objectives, this phase will result in explicit media objectives; such as creating a positive brand image through stimulating creativity. These objectives should be limited to those that can only be obtained through media strategies.\n\nMedia strategy development and implementation is the third phase and is the point in the process that is directly influenced by the actions from previously determined objectives. Actions that meet these objectives are taken into consideration with the following criteria; media mix, target market, coverage consideration, geographic coverage, scheduling, reach & frequency, creative aspects & mood, flexibility, or budget considerations. Each of these criteria are explained briefly below:\n\nThe final phase in the media plan is to evaluate the effectiveness of the plan and determine what follow-up is required. It is important to assess whether each individual marketing and media objective was met, as if they were successful it will be beneficial to use a similar model in future plans.\n\n== Components of a media plan ==\nMedia planning's major steps include:\n\n== Factors to consider when comparing various advertising media ==\nReach and frequency are important aspects of an advertising plan and are used to analyze alternative advertising schedules to determine which produce the best results relative to the media plan's objectives. Generally speaking, you will use reach when you are looking to increase your consumer base by getting more people buying your product and you will privilege frequency when you need to narrow down your communication to a more specific audience but need to increase the number of times they could be exposed to your message in order to generate a change in behavior.\n\nCalculate reach and frequency and then compare the two on the basis of how many people will be reached with each schedule and the number of times the ad will connect with the average person. Let's say the ad appeared in each of four television programs (A, B, C, D), and each program has a 20 rating, resulting in a total of 80 gross rating points. It is possible that some viewers will see more than one announcement—some viewers of program A might also see program B, C, or D, or any combination of them.\n\nFor example, in a population of 100 TV homes, a total of 40 are exposed to one or more TV programs. The reach of the four programs combined is therefore 40 percent (40 homes reached divided by the 100 TV-home population).\n\nResearchers have charted the reach achieved with different media schedules. These tabulations are put into formulas from which the level of delivery (reach) for any given schedule can be estimated. A reach curve is the technical term describing how reach changes with increasing use of a medium.\n\nNow assume the same schedule of one commercial in each of four TV programs (A, B, C, D) to determine reach versus frequency. In our example, 17 homes viewed only one program, 11 homes viewed two programs, seven viewed three programs, and five homes viewed all four programs. If we add the number of programs each home viewed, the 40 homes in total viewed the equivalent of 80 programs and therefore were exposed to the equivalent of 80 commercials. By dividing 80 by 40, we establish that any one home was exposed to an average of two commercials.\n\nTo increase reach, include additional media in the plan or expand the timing of the message. For example, if purchasing \"drive time\" on the radio, some daytime and evening spots will increase the audience. To increase frequency, add spots or insertions to the schedule. For example, if running three insertions in a local magazine, increase that to six insertions so that the audience would be exposed to the ad more often.\n\nGross rating points (GRPs) are used to estimate broadcast reach and frequency from tabulations and formulas. Once the scheduled delivery has been determined from reach curves, obtain the average frequency by dividing the GRPs by the reach. For example, 200 GRPs divided by an 80 percent reach equals a 2.5 average frequency.\n\n== Reach and Frequency ==\nIn media planning, reach is one of the most important factors, as the whole media planning is all about reach. The Purpose of the reach is exposure of brand (Belch & Belch, 2012). The higher the reach; the higher the brand exposure (Belch & Belch, 2012). And of course, higher exposure means high chances of new customers. When it comes to media planning most of the businesses decide well in advanced what their target market would be (Belch & Belch, 2012). They Choose their target market on the assumption that they already know who their customers would be (Ossi, 2015). Even though, choosing a target market for reach in media planning could be a very successful way to get to the potential customers of the brand, but this method leaves out potential customers outside of the target market; Customers the brand thought were not important to reach to (Ossi, 2015). Smart businesses also reach outside of their targeted market in order to know other segments that could be targeted (Ossi, 2015). Therefore, starting with a broader reach and then choosing target markets would be a much-informed decision; derived from actual data rather than just assumption. A broader reach is also beneficial for general brand awareness, otherwise many people outside of the targeted market never even get to hear about the brand.\n\nIn media planning, frequency is also a very important factor to consider. Most small businesses say \"We just want to see what happens\", which just wastes their money leading to disappointment on media planning (\"The importance of frequency,\" n.d.). In Advertisement, once is just not enough (\"The importance of frequency,\" n.d.). The biggest problem in media planning is; advertisers assume that someone would see their advertisement, would walk in their store and just buy something!!That is definitely not how it happens. There are five different steps for buying cycle a consumer goes through before actually purchasing something (Euan, 2013). These are awareness, interest, need, comparison and purchase (\"The importance of frequency,\" n.d.). Frequency is important as it pushes a consumer towards the actual step of purchasing something. The understanding of how exactly a consumer goes through the buying cycle is very essential to grasp the importance of frequency in media planning. Initially, the idea of reach is there to increase the awareness and exposure, but people forget. 80% of people forget the advertisement they see within 24 hours or even sooner (\"The importance of frequency when advertising,\" 2016). So, frequency is also important for awareness - decreasing the chances for forgetfulness. Secondly, frequency builds familiarity, familiarity builds trust (\"The importance of frequency,\" n.d.) and trust builds interest. In need, it is absolute that the consumer is aware of the company and have somewhat trust/ interest. And again, frequency plays essential role is remembrance, trust and interest. Higher frequency also helps to beat the competition (\"The importance of frequency when advertising,\" 2016). And finally, the consumer is on the final step of buying cycle the purchase, with the help of frequent advertisement. Without the good amount of frequency, a consumer would be very unlikely to get to the purchasing step. Thus, frequency is important because consistence advertisement reinforces top of mind brand awareness, brand favorability and brand loyalty among the current and potential consumers. Patience and effective frequency plays a great role in a business's long term success.\n\n== Unmeasured media planning ==\nPrior to having historical and current data for new media options, many of the conventional planner's tools are stymied. FCB devised an algorithm and software to indirectly measure these new potential media by comparing their planned target demographics, comparing these to their 150 topic placements. Their \"Umpire\" program measured using a \"delta square\" - the lower the better.\n\n== Tools used in Media Planning ==\nMedia Planner: also known as brand planners, brand strategist, senior media planner, work at advertising agencies and create ad campaigns for numerous clients. the media planner works with clients to help them make decisions about how a particular media campaign will perform.

A reach curve is the technical term describing how reach changes with increasing use of a medium.\n\nNow assume the same schedule of one commercial in each of four TV programs (A, B, C, D) to determine reach versus frequency. In our example, 17 homes viewed only one program, 11 homes viewed two programs, seven viewed three programs, and five homes viewed all four programs. If we add the number of programs each home viewed, the 40 homes in total viewed the equivalent of 80 programs and therefore were exposed to the equivalent of 80 commercials. By dividing 80 by 40, we establish that any one home was exposed to an average of two commercials.\n\nTo increase reach, include additional media in the plan or expand the timing of the message. For example, if purchasing \"drive time\" on the radio, some daytime and evening spots will increase the audience. To increase frequency, add spots or insertions to the schedule. For example, if running three insertions in a local magazine, increase that to six insertions so that the audience would be exposed to the ad more often.\n\nGross rating points (GRPs) are used to estimate broadcast reach and frequency from tabulations and formulas. Once the scheduled delivery has been determined from reach curves, obtain the average frequency by dividing the GRPs by the reach. For example, 200 GRPs divided by an 80 percent reach equals a 2.5 average frequency.\n\n== Reach and Frequency ==\nIn media planning, reach is one of the most important factors, as the whole media planning is all about reach. The Purpose of the reach is exposure of brand (Belch & Belch, 2012). The higher the reach; the higher the brand exposure (Belch & Belch, 2012). And of course, higher exposure means high chances of new customers. When it comes to media planning most of the businesses decide well in advanced what their target market would be (Belch & Belch, 2012). They Choose their target market on the assumption that they already know who their customers would be (Ossi, 2015). Even though, choosing a target market for reach in media planning could be a very successful way to get to the potential customers of the brand, but this method leaves out potential customers outside of the target market; Customers the brand thought were not important to reach to (Ossi, 2015). Smart businesses also reach outside of their targeted market in order to know other segments that could be targeted (Ossi, 2015). Therefore, starting with a broader reach and then choosing target markets would be a much-informed decision; derived from actual data rather than just assumption. A broader reach is also beneficial for general brand awareness, otherwise many people outside of the targeted market never even get to hear about the brand.\n\nIn media planning, frequency is also a very important factor to consider. Most small businesses say \"We just want to see what happens\", which just wastes their money leading to disappointment on media planning (\"The importance of frequency,\" n.d.). In Advertisement, once is just not enough (\"The importance of frequency,\" n.d.). The biggest problem in media planning is; advertisers assume that someone would see their advertisement, would walk in their store and just buy something!!That is definitely not how it happens. There are five different steps for buying cycle a consumer goes through before actually purchasing something (Euan, 2013). These are awareness, interest, need, comparison and purchase (\"The importance of frequency,\" n.d.). Frequency is important as it pushes a consumer towards the actual step of purchasing something. The understanding of how exactly a consumer goes through the buying cycle is very essential to grasp the importance of frequency in media planning. Initially, the idea of reach is there to increase the awareness and exposure, but people forget. 80% of people forget the advertisement they see within 24 hours or even sooner (\"The importance of frequency when advertising,\" 2016). So, frequency is also important for awareness - decreasing the chances for forgetfulness. Secondly, frequency builds familiarity, familiarity builds trust (\"The importance of frequency,\" n.d.) and trust builds interest. In need, it is absolute that the consumer is aware of the company and have somewhat trust/ interest. And again, frequency plays essential role is remembrance, trust and interest. Higher frequency also helps to beat the competition (\"The importance of frequency when advertising,\" 2016). And finally, the consumer is on the final step of buying cycle the purchase, with the help of frequent advertisement. Without the good amount of frequency, a consumer would be very unlikely to get to the purchasing step. Thus, frequency is important because consistence advertisement reinforces top of mind brand awareness, brand favorability and brand loyalty among the current and potential consumers. Patience and effective frequency plays a great role in a business's long term success.\n\n== Unmeasured media planning ==\nPrior to having historical and current data for new media options, many of the conventional planner's tools are stymied. FCB devised an algorithm and software to indirectly measure these new potential media by comparing their planned target demographics, comparing these to their 150 topic placements. Their \"Umpire\" program measured using a \"delta square\" - the lower the better.\n\n== Tools used in Media Planning ==\nMedia Planner: also known as brand planners, brand strategist, senior media planner, work at advertising agencies and create ad campaigns for numerous clients. the media planner works with clients to help them make decisions about how a particular media campaign will perform. Bring business solutions for their clients, analyzing data, thinking creatively, and designing innovative strategies.\"\"\""}

These dates are based on the period of office of the Abbé Hellin, parish priest of the church, known to have commissioned it, for in his obituary in the contemporary Chronicon Rythmicum Leodiense (Template:Lang-en) the font is clearly described, though with no mention of the artist. Both cathedral and church were destroyed during the French Revolution, and the font was hidden for safe-keeping before being moved to its present location in 1804. The Liège chronicle describes a cover with figures of the Four Evangelists and prophets, presumably also in metal, which was lost during the Revolution, along with two of the supporting oxen. The present stone plinth and setting replaced in the 20th century a solid round stone one built in 1804. The font is still used for baptisms today; there is normally a small charge for viewing it.\n\n== Renier de Huy ==\nThe font was traditionally attributed to Renier de Huy, a 12th-century metalworker and sculptor, but this, and even the Mosan origin of the font, have been questioned and alternative theories advanced. Nothing is known of Rainer's life other than that he was mentioned in a document of 1125 as a goldsmith, but a 14th-century chronicle mentions him as the artist of the font. He may have died about 1150. Another equally shadowy figure in Mosan metalwork from the next generation, Godefroid de Huy or de Claire, also came from the small but prosperous city of Huy on the Meuse.\n\nThe only other work generally agreed to be by the same master as the font is a small bronze crucifix (Schnütgen Museum, Cologne); another in Brussels has many similarities. A censer in similar style is attributed to Renier or a follower by many.\n\n== Style and origin ==\nThe figures on the font are in very high relief, and have a remarkable classicism of style; so much so that it has also been suggested that it was in fact made in Constantinople, or by Greeks in Rome about 1000. Other explanations attribute the classicism to close Byzantine influence, though as Honour and Fleming point out, \"In bodily proportions, poses, gestures and garments, they recall Classical models far beyond Byzantine, Carolingian, or even Early Christian art\"; they suggest the artist might have seen ancient Greek sculptures in Constantinople when on the First Crusade. Other writers explain the style as emerging from older Mosan and Carolingian traditions, with recent Byzantine influence, and prefiguring Gothic figure style. The idealized figures are modelled in rounded forms; several nude figures are present, and one is seen from behind in a three-quarters view, a sophisticated classical pose.\n\nArt-historical argument over the origin of the font has been vigorous and sometimes acrimonious, and in recent decades mostly conducted in French. In support of the Byzantine origin theory, analysis of the lead in 1993 has shown that it came from mines in Spain or Sardinia, whereas other Mosan works used locally sourced metal. Pierre Colman and his wife Berthe Lhoist-Colman have developed a \"Roman\" theory, according to which the Holy Roman Emperor Otto III commissioned the font from Greek craftsmen in Rome in about 1000, as a gift for the Basilica of Saint John Lateran there. Decades later it was carried off by Henry IV or Henry V to the Meuse. However most art historians continue to accept the traditional Mosan attribution, and relate the style to the other works mentioned above.\n\n== Description ==\nThe basin is 91 centimetres (36 in) across at the top, tapering slightly towards the base, and is variously described as of brass or bronze. It was made by lost wax casting, with the basin cast in a single piece; the size was not necessarily exceptional, as both church bells and cauldrons for large households were probably cast at comparable sizes; some church doors cast in a single piece, though flat, were much larger. The font sat on twelve oxen (two are now missing), who emerged from a stone plinth, a reference to the \"molten sea... on twelve oxen\" cast in bronze for Solomon's temple The five scenes shown, identified by Latin inscriptions (\"tituli\") on the rim above and in the image field, can be read in chronological sequence:\n\nExcept for the last two the scenes are separated by trees which are stylised in typical Romanesque fashion, but whose leaf shapes are all different.

The school enrolled 84 students aged 4–13 during its first semester at the Hotel Rigiblick. There were five staff members employed at the time as well as the founder Gerald Atkinson and his wife.\n\nIn May 1961, ICS signed a lease with the city of Zurich for the rental of a lakeside villa (which in the 1930s had been renovated for use by Prince Paul of Yugoslavia) In September of that year, ICS began its second year of operation in the new villa with 160 students enrolled.\n\nBy 1967, there were 200 students enrolled from kindergarten to seventh grade with two classes per grade. Rooms were in short supply, therefore facility was found in Regensdorf. Shortly thereafter, the upper primary classes were moved to Regensdorf, while the lower primary classes remained in the lakeside villa on Seefeldquai. The search for one facility to house the entire school was now underway.\n\nThe founder of ICS Gerald Atkinson relinquished his ownership of the school in 1968, to facilitate the process of ICS gaining the legal non-profit foundation status. This non-profit foundation status would make it easier to raise funds for the purchasing of a new building. On August 1, 1968, the Foundation of The Inter-Community School was established under the Swiss Civil Code.\n\nThe school is famed for its unique campus. Situated within a former penitentiary, the Inter-Community School Zurich (ICSZ) is one of the only IB schools in a historical prison.\n\n== 1970-1986 ==\nIn early 1970 the municipality of Dübendorf, a suburb near Zurich, had just completed the construction of a new primary school, but only required half of the rooms. ICS was offered the use of the other half of the building for one year, while another more permanent location was sought. In April 1970, the lower primary classes moved out of the lakeside villa in Zurich to the new temporary facility in Dübendorf. The upper primary classes remained in Regensdorf during this period.\n\nAt the same time, the board of trustees had found a farmer in Zumikon who was willing to sell ICS some of his land. The contract for the purchase was signed in November 1970. After receiving two major loans from Credit Suisse and the Union Bank of Switzerland, ICS was ready to build its own facility. Construction began in November 1971 and was completed in December 1972. When the winter term began in 1973, the entire school was under one roof - this was the Primary School building. 270 students were now enrolled at ICS. In 1977 additional land was purchased, and extensions to the Primary School building were done in 1979 and 1982. Shortly thereafter in 1985, a library and kindergarten were built.\n\nThe 1974 'Brink Report' by the Board of Trustees formulated plans for the development of a secondary school at ICS. The first pavilion was erected in 1987 as the first secondary school classroom.\n\n== Academics ==\nThe medium of instruction is English, but all children above Kindergarten must study German. From grade 6, students are also required to study a third language (French or Spanish). The academic curriculum of the school is based upon the programmes of the International Baccalaureate, and ICS is the only Zurich area school authorized to offer the IB programmes at all levels. The IB programmes are designed to facilitate transition to and from national education systems and entry into universities around the world.\n\nClass maximum size varies between 16 and 24 depending upon grade level and there is a student-teacher ratio of approximately 8:1.\n\nJust under half of the student body is composed of native speakers of English, and the school has a programme of English as an additional language (EAL) and learning support.\"\"\""}

Although Klengel was a professor at the Leipzig Conservatoire, Suggia did not enroll there but rather took private lessons from him\n\nWithin a year Suggia was asked to appear as a soloist with the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra under its conductor, Arthur Nikisch. From 1906 to 1912 she lived and worked in Paris with the cellist Pablo Casals. It was generally believed, incorrectly, that the two were married, and Suggia was sometimes billed as \"Mme P. Casals-Suggia\". She began to tour internationally, building her reputation. She and Casals were rated as \"the world's leading cellists\". Casals was close friends with composer Donald Tovey, who wrote his Sonata for two cellos for the pair. On visiting the couple to present the work in 1912, an unknown event occurred between Suggia and Tovey which caused strain on the relationship between Suggia and Casals, and the friendship between Tovey and Casals. After they separated, Suggia retained her admiration for Casals, describing him as pre-eminent among living cellists. In 1914 she formed a trio with the violinist Jelly d'Arányi and the pianist Fanny Davies. During the period of her residence in Britain during the 1920s and 1930s, she was a frequent visitor to Lindisfarne Castle in northern England, where a cello now rests in the Music Room in commemoration of her time spent there. Her \"Montagnana\" cello rests in Conservatório de Música do Porto, her home-town in Portugal.\n\nEdward Hudson,the founder of the British magazine ‘Country Life’ is said to have been infatuated by Guilhermina.

During World War II, Suggia and her husband returned to Portugal, where she lived in retirement. She visited Britain after the war, giving performances of the Elgar Cello Concerto in aid of charity. She gave her last concerts at the Edinburgh Festival in 1949 and in Bournemouth later the same year.\n\nSuggia died of cancer in Porto at the age of 65, a year after the death of her husband.\n\n== Recordings ==\nSuggia made a small number of gramophone recordings. They include Haydn's D major Concerto with John Barbirolli and Saint-Saëns's A minor Concerto with Lawrence Collingwood. They were reissued on compact disc in 1989 (EMI EH761083-1).

Although land-based fire-engines are able to reach much of the fire ground, waterborne fire-engines, or fire-floats, can fight the fire from the water (outside the UK fire-floats are commonly known as fireboats).\n\nThe first recorded fire-float was built in 1765 for the Sun Fire Insurance Company in London. This was a manual pump in a small boat, rowed by its crew to the scene of the fire. A similar craft was built in Bristol by James Hilhouse for the Imperial Fire Insurance Office in the 1780s. All fire fighting in Bristol was carried out either by private insurance companies or the Docks Company until the formation of the Bristol Fire Brigade as a branch of the police in 1876.\n\nBy the middle of the nineteenth century, self-propelled steam-fire-floats were beginning to be introduced. The first to appear in Bristol was the Fire Queen, built by Shand Mason & Co., London, in 1884 for service in Bristol City Docks. The 53-foot (16 m) long craft was equipped with a three-cylinder steam-pump supplying two large hose reels; one of these was replaced with a monitor, or water-cannon, in 1900. Fire Queen served until 1922.\n\nIn 1905, the Fire Brigade took delivery of the Salamander, built by G.K. Stothert & Co., Hotwells, Bristol, and equipped with Merryweather pumps and two monitors. Salamander served at Avonmouth Docks for many years. She demonstrated the major drawback of steam-powered fire-floats one day in 1917: a fire was discovered at 7:30 a.m. in a transit shed at Avonmouth Dock, and Salamander was called out. By 8:30 am shore appliances had almost extinguished the fire. Meanwhile, Salamander had finally raised sufficient steam to lend a hand, and arrived at 8:36 a.m.\n\nAs well as the two specialised craft, a number of craft owned by the Port Authority were fitted with fire-fighting equipment. These included the tug/tender Brunel, and the multi-purpose workboat Bulldog. The Port also owned and operated the fire-float Denny, built in 1916 for service at Portishead Dock. Denny served until 1953.\n\nIn 1921, Fire Queen was replaced as the City Docks' fire-float by Phoenix, built in London and petrol-engined. Ten years later, the Fire Brigade reconsidered their requirements in the Port of Bristol. The cost of installing diesel engines in Salamander was investigated, but proved too expensive to be worthwhile, and instead the Brigade ordered two new fire-floats, one for Avonmouth and one for the City Docks. Charles Hill & Sons Ltd., Albion Dockyard, Bristol, successfully tendered for both. In 1934 the Bristol Phoenix II (later renamed Pyronaut) was launched, followed in 1936 by Endres Gane.\n\nBristol Phoenix II was taken into commission in June 1934, working from the Prince Street Bridge river police station. Her crew consisted of three firemen, including an engineer stationed below in the noisy engine room. He responded to orders transmitted from the wheel by the ship's telegraph, and controlled the speed and direction of each engine and watched over the pumps at the fire.\n\nSurviving records show that in her first two years at work Bristol Phoenix II attended major fires at Robbins Ltd., Imperial Saw Mills, Cumberland Road (now part of the Baltic Wharf housing estate) Charles Hill & Sons Ltd.'s shipyard and William Butler's tar distillation works at Crew's Hole, Bristol. These sites were at opposite ends of the City Docks, almost five miles apart, and to allow the fire-float to reach the fire quickly, it was important that she should be able to pass under Prince Street swing bridge (the lowest in the Docks) without the bridge opening. This limitation meant that the fire-float's air-draught (the hull and superstructure above the waterline) was very low, and the helmsman had to lie flat on the deck when navigating some of the bridges.\n\nIn 1938, it was discovered that a second vessel named Phoenix appeared on the Bristol Ship Register, and, because this is not permitted, the fire-float was renamed Pyronaut (a name thought up by the teenage son of the Chairman of the Watch Committee). Shortly after this, in November 1938, one of the most serious peacetime fires in the City Docks broke out, at Samuel Thompson & Sons' malthouse (later known as the MacArthur warehouse) in Gas Ferry Road. The fire raged through the building, causing £46,000 of damage before it was extinguished by Pyronaut and several shore appliances.\n\n== World War II ==\nEarly in 1939 several small fires at various places in the City Docks preceded a major fire at the Cumberland Road premises of the Anglo-American Asphalt Co. In the following year, Pyronaut embarked upon her busiest period, as the air raids of the Bristol Blitz damaged and destroyed countless warehouses, factories, shops and homes around the Floating Harbour. Operating alongside two motor-launches fitted with fire-fighting equipment, Pyronaut was constantly manned and working through the worst raids of the war.\n\n== Peacetime service ==\nThe return to peacetime duties meant less work for the fire-floats, but major fires still occurred. In February 1948 there was a serious blaze at the Hippodrome Theatre, and Pyronaut pumped water from the head of St Augustine's Reach. It was the height of the pantomime season, and amongst the salvage was some of the clothing for the cast, including Sid Phasey's dress suit. A reporter recorded the scene: ‘I find clusters of men soaked to the skin, their eyes red-rimmed with the smoke and fumes, plying their hoses oblivious to the danger that threatened them every minute from above’.\n\nIn 1949, a serious fire in wastepaper stacks at St. Anne's Board Mill required the attendance of Pyronaut and many shore appliances, as well as the company’s own motor-launch fire-float. When Rowe Bros' lead works warehouses on Canons' Marsh caught fire in 1950, Pyronaut pumped water from the City Docks. In September 1951, the most serious peacetime oil fire to date broke out at Avonmouth Docks, and Pyronaut made the journey down the River Avon to attend; she pumped water continually for two days. The following year saw her fighting a dangerous fire aboard the m.v. Stalheim in the city docks.\n\nIn quieter moments, the crew regularly took Pyronaut for drill periods, to familiarise themselves with the equipment and performance of the craft. A favourite destination during drill was Beese’s Tea Garden at Conham.\n\n== Closure of Bristol City Docks ==\nBy 1967, the equipment of Pyronaut and Endres Gane was becoming worn out and obsolete. A new fire-float for Avonmouth Docks, the Aquanaut, was ordered from Thames Launch Works Ltd., London, and delivered in 1969. Powered by twin Thornycroft diesel engines driving Schottel propulsion units, the new craft was very manoeuvrable, and her Rolls-Royce turbocharged pumps allowed her to deliver 2,000 imperial gallons (9,100 L; 2,400 US gal) of water per minute through hoses and four monitors; additionally, she carried large tanks for foam which was discharged through a fifth, dual-purpose, monitor. Aquanaut replaced the Endres Gane, which was sold into private hands; she can still be seen acting as a storage hulk in the city docks.\n\nInstead of buying a new fire-float for the city docks, it was decided to re-equip Pyronaut, and this was carried out in 1968 to 1969, at Charles Hill's. Her Petter Atomic diesel engines and Merryweather reciprocating pumps were replaced with Ruston & Hornsby diesels. These were installed with the normal drive facing forwards, so that the full power of the engines could be applied to the new Coventry Climax centrifugal pumps, and yet still provide sufficient power from the auxiliary end of the engines to drive the screws. At the same time, remote controls of the engine from the steering position was introduced, so that it was no longer necessary to station an engineer in the engine room at all times.\n\n== 1972 review ==\nDespite these improvements, Pyronaut's working days were numbered. In 1969, the decision to close Bristol City Docks to commercial traffic by 1975 was announced and a review of the fire cover in the city docks in 1972 noted that very few buildings remained which could not be reached on all sides by land-based fire-engines. Consequently, Pyronaut was put up for sale in 1973. Seven years later Aquanaut was also sold, and fire cover in the Avonmouth and Royal Portbury Docks became the responsibility of land-based fire appliances and new tugs equipped with fire-fighting equipment.\n\nPyronaut was sold to the Port of Bristol Authority, who took her to Avonmouth and began work on converting her into a divers' boat. This entailed removing all the fire-fighting pumps and moving her engines forward in the hull to create space for a changing room. The work was never completed, and she was sold again to a private owner in 1983, who began to fit out the changing room as a saloon, with the intention of using Pyronaut as a working/living craft in the south of Ireland. Shortly before completing the work in 1989, he decided to sell the vessel to Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery, based at the now-closed Bristol Industrial Museum where restoration and preservation was completed in 1995. Pyronaut can now be seen outside the new M Shed museum, berthed with the museum‘s tugs Mayflower and John King. Listed as part of the National Historic Fleet, she performs displays during major harbour events as well as operating for trips on some summer weekends. In June 2012 she travelled to London by road to take part in the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Pageant.", "src": "== Fire-floats in Bristol ==\nWhen ships loaded with valuable cargoes are berthed together in crowded docks surrounded by warehouses, a fire can be disastrous.

This was a manual pump in a small boat, rowed by its crew to the scene of the fire. A similar craft was built in Bristol by James Hilhouse for the Imperial Fire Insurance Office in the 1780s.

Perović completed local female gymnasium (e.g. preparatory high school or grammar school) in Kragujevac in 1952. She graduated in history at the University of Belgrade and earned a PhD degree in political science 1975 at the same university. Earlier, she also earned her master degree at the Faculty of Political Science in Begrade in 1965.\n\nAt the age of 27, she was already president of the Conference for the Women's Social Activity of Yugoslavia (1960-1964). Perović was Secretary of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Serbia from 1968 to 1972. She was considered the most influential woman in Serbia at that time and the only one who did not gain her position based on marriage with a more powerful man than herself, but rather through her own intelligence, competence and ambition.\n\nIn 1972 Marko Nikezić (the president of the CC of the LCS) and Perović were removed from their positions because Josip Broz Tito considered their views too liberal. After that, she never returned to politics. Perović devoted herself to historical research and became known as one of the most prominent experts on Serbian history from the 19th century onwards.\n\nFrom 1976 to 1998 Perović worked at the Institute for Recent History of Serbia. In her writings and studies on modern Serbia, she often emphasizes that Serbia needs a politician who would publicly claim responsibility for the destruction wrought in the former Yugoslavia in order to help the reconciliation with the neighboring states and prevent the recurrence of this kind of tragedy. She was opposed to the regime of Slobodan Milošević, calling his political system a \"culture of murder\".

In the UK, he was known as the face of a long-running series of television advertisements for British Airways in the 1990s.\n\nO'Rourke also worked on screenplays in Hollywood, including Rodney Dangerfield's Easy Money.\n\nIn 2009, O'Rourke described the nascent presidency of Barack Obama as \"the Carter administration in better sweaters\". However, in 2016, he endorsed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump. O'Rourke stated that his endorsement included her \"lies and empty promises\" and added \"She's wrong about absolutely everything, but she's wrong within normal parameters\".\n\n== Personal life ==\nFrom 1990 to 1993, O'Rourke was married to Amy Lumet, a daughter of movie director Sidney Lumet and a granddaughter of Lena Horne. In 1995, he married Tina Mallon, and they had three children: daughters Elizabeth and Olivia and son Clifford. In an interview with the New Statesman published in January 2012, O'Rourke said, \"Despite my name, I wasn't raised a Catholic. My mother was a Protestant, of a traditional American, vague kind: she belonged to the church that the nice people in the neighbourhood went to. My wife is a Catholic, the kids are Catholic, so I'm a Catholic fellow-traveller.\"\n\nIn September 2008, O'Rourke announced that he had been diagnosed with treatable rectal cancer, from which he expected \"a 95% chance of survival\". O'Rourke died from lung cancer at his home in Sharon, New Hampshire, on February 15, 2022, at the age of 74.\n\n== Writing ==\nO'Rourke was a proponent of gonzo journalism; one of his earliest and best-regarded pieces was \"How to Drive Fast on Drugs While Getting Your Wing-Wang Squeezed and Not Spill Your Drink\", a National Lampoon article in March 1979. The article was republished in two of his books, Republican Party Reptile (1987) and Driving Like Crazy (2009).\n\nO'Rourke's best-received book is Parliament of Whores, subtitled A Lone Humorist Attempts to Explain the Entire U.S. Government, whose main argument, according to the author, \"is that politics are boring\". He described himself as a libertarian.\n\nO'Rourke typed his manuscripts on an IBM Selectric typewriter, though he denied being a Luddite, asserting that his short attention span would have made focusing on writing on a computer difficult.\"\"\""}

Smith in 1942\nNickname(s): \"Iceberg\" Smith\nBorn: 29 October 1889 Vineyard Haven, Massachusetts\nDied: 29 October 1961 (aged 72) Quissett, Massachusetts, U.S.\nBuried: Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, U.S.\nAllegiance: United States of America\nService / branch: United States Navy\nYears of service: 1910–1950\nRank: Rear admiral\nAwards: Navy Distinguished Service Medal\nOther work: Director of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, 1950–1956\n\n== Early life and career ==\nSmith attended high schools at Vineyard Haven and New Bedford, Massachusetts. After attending one year at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Smith was appointed a cadet at the Revenue Cutter Service School of Instruction on 8 May 1910 and after graduation was commissioned as a third lieutenant 7 June 1913. One of his classmates was Coast Guard aviation pioneer Elmer F. Stone. Smith's first assignment was aboard USRC Seminole home-ported at Wilmington, North Carolina where he served as the cutter junior engineering officer. In February 1915 he was transferred to USCGC Acushnet and USCGC Apache before be returning to USCGC Seminole. He remained assigned there until 4 August 1917 when he was transferred to USCGC Manning which escorted troop and supply convoys to Europe during World War I. During his tour of duty aboard Manning, Smith was promoted to second lieutenant on 7 June 1918. After short tours aboard USCGC Tallapoosa and USS Antigone from January to November 1919, Smith was assigned to USCGC Seneca, which was one of two cutters assigned annually to the International Ice Patrol.\n\n== International Ice Patrol ==\nBecause the Coast Guard had been tasked with staffing the International Ice Patrol as a result of the sinking of the RMS Titanic in 1912, the service had always looked for ways to predict the path of icebergs that entered North Atlantic shipping lanes. President Woodrow Wilson issued an executive order on 7 February 1914 requiring the Coast Guard to assign two vessels to derelict destruction and patrol work in the North Atlantic for the remainder of the year, except that \"the study and observation of ice conditions shall be effectively maintained, in particular from the beginning of February to the opening of the ice season.\" Although patrol activities had been suspended during World War I, the resumption of patrol work in 1919 included the Coast Guard hydrographer for the first time so that the Interdepartmental Board on International Service of Ice Observation, Ice Patrol and Ocean Derelict Destruction established by Wilson in 1916 could prepare a systematic program of scientific observations and publish the findings.\n\nSmith was promoted to first lieutenant on 12 January 1923. He became interested in the scientific study of oceanography and the movement of icebergs during his assignment aboard Seneca, and remained assigned as an Ice Patrol hydrographer until August 1924 when he was directed by Coast Guard Headquarters to work with Vilhelm Bjerknes at the Bergen School of Meteorology. Bjerknes was internationally known for his studies of how wind currents interact with ocean currents to produce weather patterns and Smith studied his methods of measuring ocean currents. In August 1925, Smith spent three months at the British Meteorological Institute collecting data for use with the Ice Patrol before returning the United States and Ice Patrol duties. He received permission to study at Harvard University when Seneca wasn't on Ice Patrol duties. In 1925, Smith published A Practical Means for Determining Ocean Currents, which was utilized as a work bulletin throughout the Coast Guard.\n\n== Marion expedition ==\nIn early 1928, Frederick C. Billard, Commandant of the Coast Guard, directed that Smith outfit USCGC Marion for an oceanographic expedition of the Davis Strait to study the formation of icebergs and study their movement as well as take scientific readings of the sea water and depth soundings. Marion left Boston, Massachusetts on 11 July with Smith as commanding officer of a crew of 26 bound for the Strait of Belle Isle off the Labrador coast. At intervals, Smith oversaw the taking of temperature and salinity readings at various depths as well as bottom sample and depth soundings at each observation station. Upon the expedition's completion on 18 September, some 2,000 observations of temperature and salinity had been taken along with numerous bottom samples together with soundings. The soundings were added to existing charts and added to the general knowledge of the 450,000 square miles of the Davis Strait that the expedition encompassed.\n\n== Pre-World War II career ==\nAfter his successful completion of the Marion expedition, Smith was reassigned to Rum Patrol duties as commanding officer of several cutters including the Coast Guard destroyers Henley, Downes, Shaw, Tucker and George E. Badger from 1928 to 1936. He was promoted to lieutenant commander on 21 April 1929. During times when the cutters he was assigned had maintenance availabilities at dockside, Smith worked on his doctoral thesis at Harvard University and was awarded a doctor of philosophy degree in geologic and oceanographic physics on 19 June 1930 using his Marion expedition research as a basis of his dissertation. Smith was recommended by Harvard University, the American Geographic Society and the National Academy of Sciences to go on an expedition aboard the German dirigible Graf Zeppelin in 1931. The original plan was to fly from Spitzbergen to Fairbanks, Alaska and return passing over the North Pole; however, the plans changed and a shorter flight was made from Leningrad over the Kara Sea during the week of 24 July to 1 August 1931.\n\nSmith was promoted to the rank of commander 1 October 1934. In June 1936 he was assigned as commanding officer of USCGC Tahoe but was transferred in February 1937 to the newly commissioned USCGC Spencer as her first commanding officer. While Smith was assigned to Spencer he was cited by the Department of the Navy for his role in the rescue of the crew of USS Swallow after she ran aground at Kanaga Island on 19 February 1938. In October 1938 he was transferred to Boston and was designated as Commander, International Ice Patrol and also assumed command of USCGC Chelan. He commanded the Ice Patrol for the 1939 and 1940 seasons.\n\n== Greenland Patrol and World War II ==\nIn June 1940, Smith was assigned as commanding officer of USCGC Northland while assuming duties as commander of the Greenland Patrol, which was responsible for Ice Patrol duties as well as assisting the Army and the Navy with establishing bases for the military defense of Greenland. Although the Commandant of the Coast Guard, Admiral Russell R. Waesche, wanted to discontinue the Ice Patrol activities for the 1941 season, it was suggested by President Franklin D. Roosevelt that the Ice Patrol might be a good cover for investigating reports that the German Navy might be attempting to establish weather stations along Greenland's eastern coast. As part of an agreement with the government of Denmark, Smith organized the Danish and Eskimo manned Northeast Greenland Sledge Patrol to patrol the eastern shores of Greenland in an effort to detect German weather stations. Smith was named as Commander, Northeast Greenland Patrol which consisted of USCGC Bear and USCGC North Star as well as Northland. In early September 1941, the Sledge Patrol reported the position of a vessel that had landed men in Greenland. Northland made contact with the Norwegian sealer Buskoe and put a prize crew aboard. A shore party from Northland located an unauthorized radio station manned by a shore party of four from Buskoe. Buskoe was towed to Boston by Bear and the crew of Buskoe were charged as illegal immigrants and not as prisoners of war because the United States was not at war at the time.\n\nAfter the Buskoe incident, the Northeast and South Greenland Patrols were combined under Smith's command as the Greenland Patrol in October 1941. Smith was promoted to the rank of captain 1 December 1941. After the United States declared war on Germany in December 1941, Smith requested additional cutters to support the patrol in its increased mission load. In addition to watching the eastern coast of Greenland, the Greenland Patrol was tasked with escort duties and search and rescue work as well as helping establish LORAN radio navigation stations and installing aids to navigation so that supply ships could safely enter harbors near newly established airfields. Smith was promoted to the rank of rear admiral 30 June 1942 and on 21 November 1943 became Commander, Navy Task Force 24 which included the Greenland Patrol. Smith was awarded the Navy Distinguished Service Medal for his leadership of the Greenland Patrol and Task Force 24 by Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal. He was also made a Commander First Class of the Order of the Dannebrog by the King of Denmark.\n\n== Post-war Coast Guard assignments ==\nWith the end of World War II, Smith was reassigned to be Commander, Third Coast Guard District based at New York City in August 1945 with additional duties as Commander, Eastern Area being assigned after May 1946. As a collateral duty he was also Captain of the Port of New York during this assignment and also oversaw all Captain of the Port activities within the Third District. From 1946 to 1949 Smith also served on the staff of the Applied Physics Laboratory of Johns Hopkins University. On 1 January 1948, his wartime promotion to rear admiral was made permanent. Beginning in 1949 he served as a project leader for the Weapons System Evaluation Group at the Department of Defense and worked in that capacity until his retirement on 30 June 1950.\n\n== Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution ==\nThrough his former Harvard master's degree advisor, Dr. Henry Bryant Bigelow, then scientific advisor to the International Ice Patrol, Smith become elected to the board of trustees of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in 1945; a post he served in until 1961 when he became an honorary trustee. On 1 July 1950, Smith was named director of the institution and served in that capacity until 1956. After he retired as director he remained on the staff of the institution until his death. During his tenure as director, he was responsible for the construction of the Laboratory of Oceanography building at the institute as well as the acquisition of Research Vessel Crawford, which was the former Coast Guard Cutter Crawford.\n\n== Personal history ==\nSmith was a member of the American Geophysical Union, the Arctic Institute of North America, the Aero-Arctic Society, and the Propeller Club of New York.

President Woodrow Wilson issued an executive order on 7 February 1914 requiring the Coast Guard to assign two vessels to derelict destruction and patrol work in the North Atlantic for the remainder of the year, except that \"the study and observation of ice conditions shall be effectively maintained, in particular from the beginning of February to the opening of the ice season.\" Although patrol activities had been suspended during World War I, the resumption of patrol work in 1919 included the Coast Guard hydrographer for the first time so that the Interdepartmental Board on International Service of Ice Observation, Ice Patrol and Ocean Derelict Destruction established by Wilson in 1916 could prepare a systematic program of scientific observations and publish the findings.\n\nSmith was promoted to first lieutenant on 12 January 1923. He became interested in the scientific study of oceanography and the movement of icebergs during his assignment aboard Seneca, and remained assigned as an Ice Patrol hydrographer until August 1924 when he was directed by Coast Guard Headquarters to work with Vilhelm Bjerknes at the Bergen School of Meteorology. Bjerknes was internationally known for his studies of how wind currents interact with ocean currents to produce weather patterns and Smith studied his methods of measuring ocean currents. In August 1925, Smith spent three months at the British Meteorological Institute collecting data for use with the Ice Patrol before returning the United States and Ice Patrol duties. He received permission to study at Harvard University when Seneca wasn't on Ice Patrol duties. In 1925, Smith published A Practical Means for Determining Ocean Currents, which was utilized as a work bulletin throughout the Coast Guard.\n\n== Marion expedition ==\nIn early 1928, Frederick C. Billard, Commandant of the Coast Guard, directed that Smith outfit USCGC Marion for an oceanographic expedition of the Davis Strait to study the formation of icebergs and study their movement as well as take scientific readings of the sea water and depth soundings. Marion left Boston, Massachusetts on 11 July with Smith as commanding officer of a crew of 26 bound for the Strait of Belle Isle off the Labrador coast. At intervals, Smith oversaw the taking of temperature and salinity readings at various depths as well as bottom sample and depth soundings at each observation station. Upon the expedition's completion on 18 September, some 2,000 observations of temperature and salinity had been taken along with numerous bottom samples together with soundings. The soundings were added to existing charts and added to the general knowledge of the 450,000 square miles of the Davis Strait that the expedition encompassed.\n\n== Pre-World War II career ==\nAfter his successful completion of the Marion expedition, Smith was reassigned to Rum Patrol duties as commanding officer of several cutters including the Coast Guard destroyers Henley, Downes, Shaw, Tucker and George E. Badger from 1928 to 1936. He was promoted to lieutenant commander on 21 April 1929. During times when the cutters he was assigned had maintenance availabilities at dockside, Smith worked on his doctoral thesis at Harvard University and was awarded a doctor of philosophy degree in geologic and oceanographic physics on 19 June 1930 using his Marion expedition research as a basis of his dissertation. Smith was recommended by Harvard University, the American Geographic Society and the National Academy of Sciences to go on an expedition aboard the German dirigible Graf Zeppelin in 1931. The original plan was to fly from Spitzbergen to Fairbanks, Alaska and return passing over the North Pole; however, the plans changed and a shorter flight was made from Leningrad over the Kara Sea during the week of 24 July to 1 August 1931.\n\nSmith was promoted to the rank of commander 1 October 1934. In June 1936 he was assigned as commanding officer of USCGC Tahoe but was transferred in February 1937 to the newly commissioned USCGC Spencer as her first commanding officer. While Smith was assigned to Spencer he was cited by the Department of the Navy for his role in the rescue of the crew of USS Swallow after she ran aground at Kanaga Island on 19 February 1938. In October 1938 he was transferred to Boston and was designated as Commander, International Ice Patrol and also assumed command of USCGC Chelan. He commanded the Ice Patrol for the 1939 and 1940 seasons.\n\n== Greenland Patrol and World War II ==\nIn June 1940, Smith was assigned as commanding officer of USCGC Northland while assuming duties as commander of the Greenland Patrol, which was responsible for Ice Patrol duties as well as assisting the Army and the Navy with establishing bases for the military defense of Greenland. Although the Commandant of the Coast Guard, Admiral Russell R. Waesche, wanted to discontinue the Ice Patrol activities for the 1941 season, it was suggested by President Franklin D. Roosevelt that the Ice Patrol might be a good cover for investigating reports that the German Navy might be attempting to establish weather stations along Greenland's eastern coast. As part of an agreement with the government of Denmark, Smith organized the Danish and Eskimo manned Northeast Greenland Sledge Patrol to patrol the eastern shores of Greenland in an effort to detect German weather stations. Smith was named as Commander, Northeast Greenland Patrol which consisted of USCGC Bear and USCGC North Star as well as Northland. In early September 1941, the Sledge Patrol reported the position of a vessel that had landed men in Greenland. Northland made contact with the Norwegian sealer Buskoe and put a prize crew aboard. A shore party from Northland located an unauthorized radio station manned by a shore party of four from Buskoe. Buskoe was towed to Boston by Bear and the crew of Buskoe were charged as illegal immigrants and not as prisoners of war because the United States was not at war at the time.\n\nAfter the Buskoe incident, the Northeast and South Greenland Patrols were combined under Smith's command as the Greenland Patrol in October 1941. Smith was promoted to the rank of captain 1 December 1941. After the United States declared war on Germany in December 1941, Smith requested additional cutters to support the patrol in its increased mission load. In addition to watching the eastern coast of Greenland, the Greenland Patrol was tasked with escort duties and search and rescue work as well as helping establish LORAN radio navigation stations and installing aids to navigation so that supply ships could safely enter harbors near newly established airfields. Smith was promoted to the rank of rear admiral 30 June 1942 and on 21 November 1943 became Commander, Navy Task Force 24 which included the Greenland Patrol. Smith was awarded the Navy Distinguished Service Medal for his leadership of the Greenland Patrol and Task Force 24 by Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal. He was also made a Commander First Class of the Order of the Dannebrog by the King of Denmark.\n\n== Post-war Coast Guard assignments ==\nWith the end of World War II, Smith was reassigned to be Commander, Third Coast Guard District based at New York City in August 1945 with additional duties as Commander, Eastern Area being assigned after May 1946. As a collateral duty he was also Captain of the Port of New York during this assignment and also oversaw all Captain of the Port activities within the Third District. From 1946 to 1949 Smith also served on the staff of the Applied Physics Laboratory of Johns Hopkins University. On 1 January 1948, his wartime promotion to rear admiral was made permanent. Beginning in 1949 he served as a project leader for the Weapons System Evaluation Group at the Department of Defense and worked in that capacity until his retirement on 30 June 1950.\n\n== Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution ==\nThrough his former Harvard master's degree advisor, Dr. Henry Bryant Bigelow, then scientific advisor to the International Ice Patrol, Smith become elected to the board of trustees of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in 1945; a post he served in until 1961 when he became an honorary trustee. On 1 July 1950, Smith was named director of the institution and served in that capacity until 1956. After he retired as director he remained on the staff of the institution until his death. During his tenure as director, he was responsible for the construction of the Laboratory of Oceanography building at the institute as well as the acquisition of Research Vessel Crawford, which was the former Coast Guard Cutter Crawford.\n\n== Personal history ==\nSmith was a member of the American Geophysical Union, the Arctic Institute of North America, the Aero-Arctic Society, and the Propeller Club of New York. He held an unlimited Merchant Marine master mariner license. He was married to Isabel R. (Brier) Smith and was the father to three sons, Porter, Stuart, and Jeremiah. Upon his death he was cremated and is buried at Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts.\"\"\""}

During the 1960s French exploration companies identified vast evaporative zones containing sylvinite and carnallite mineralisation covering the Congo Basin.\n\nIn 1959 COMILOG commenced manganese extraction operations near the town of Moanda in Gabon, just across the Congolese border. To be able to export the manganese COMILOG built a 285 km railway line from the Congo town of Mbinda south to where it join the Congo-Ocean Railway. Ultimately trains go on to the coastal port of Pointe Noire. Although manganese is no longer moved by rail, the COMILOG line remains in use, with weekly passenger service. Conveniently, the COMIL line runs through Mayoko near the high-grade iron ore, which any mining syndicate that might want to set up new commercial operations would surely find convenient.\n\n== 1960-1985 ==\nFrom independence (1960) to 1985 industrial expansion in the mining sector was limited to the potash company, Makolo (previously Holle) and the polymetals of Mfouati District, Boko-Songho District and Mindouli. Artisanal mining was confined to exploitation of precious metals, notably gold in Kellé, Kakamoeka District, Mayoko District and in Souanké.\n\nOil production intensified during its boom period, 1975 to 1984, leading to a large increase in government revenue. This increase in revenue brought about profound changes in the structure of exports and domestic output.\n\n== 1985-1999 ==\nFrom 1985 to 1999, the Congo became structurally indebted as it struggled with political and economic difficulty despite the significant inflow of oil revenue. International investment slowed and mining virtually ceased. By 2000, gold and lime were the only minerals still being extracted.\n\n== 2000 onwards ==\nIn 2000 the government began to show a genuine commitment to developing a mining sector, and it is a central part of the country’s economic diversification program – Le Chemin d’Avenir (Path Forward).\n\nIn the past, the mining sector has been rife with corruption, which led to a suspension in 2004 of the RoC from the Kimberly Process. However, corruption has been significantly reduced and the ROC was later reinstated to the Kimberly Process after it made improvements in monitoring procedures for its mining sector.\n\nIn 2005, the government introduced a new mining code, to replace existing outdated legislation. The mining code offers prospective miners attractive and flexible terms to encourage the development of mining projects.\n\nTo support the economic diversification strategy, the government created four special economic zones, including the Pointe-Noire Special Economic Zone, located on the coast at Point Indienne, in support of developing petrochemical, iron and steel, and mining activities. In 2008 the Bureau d’Expertise, d’Evaluation et de Certification des Substances Minérales Précieuses (Bureau for Assay, Evaluation and Certification of Precious Minerals) was established with the aim of facilitating control over the scattered artisanal alluvial diamond extraction operations.\n\nSassou, the current president, has repeatedly stated he wants to build a lucrative mining industry, unlike that of the neighboring DRC, which is plagued by corruption and mismanagement. After the September 2009 elections the government formed the new Ministry of Mines and Geology, Ministère des Mines et de la Géologie, with Pierre Oba as Minister.\n\nIn early 2010, the Canadian exploration company NGEx Resources Inc was granted two exploration licences for copper-lead-zinc, over the Reneville and Kingouala areas.\n\nHanlong initiated a bid for Sundance Resources in July 2012. The bid initially valued Sundance at US$1.5 billion but was later revised to US$1.3 billion. Sundance's main asset is the Nabeba iron ore deposit, part of the Mbalam Project together with the Mbaraga deposit in neighbouring Cameroon. In February the National Development and Reform Commission of the People's Republic of China (NDRC) extended provisional approval of the bid to July 2013. On 8 April Sundance announced termination of the takeover bid after Hanlong failed to meet the funding conditions.\n\nIn December 2011, the Ministry of Mining and Geology was invited to London, to receive second place in the \"Country of the Year\" prize, after Liberia. In January of the following year, Exxaro made a US $349 million takeover offer for African Iron. In December 2012, the ministerial council approved the recommendation of the ministry for mines to grant the Nabeba mining permit.\n\nMagMinerals Inc., a division of MagIndustries Corp. of Canada, continued financing negotiations for the development of Mengo exploitation permit and the Kouilou potash processing facility. In February, TSC Capital Ltd. of Taiwan withdrew its offer to acquire up to 55% of MagIndustries. In April, Evergreen Resources Holding Ltd. of the United Kingdom, (a subsidiary of Evergreen Industries Holding Group Company, Ltd. of China), agree to acquire MagIndustries. The friendly takeover was completed in July. MagMinerals Inc., a division of MagIndustriesCorp). of Canada, continued negotiations to secure financing for the development of the Mengo exploitation permit and the Kouilou potash processing facility. In April, Evergreen Resources Holding Ltd. of the United Kingdom, a subsidiary of China's Evergreen Industries Holding Group Company, Ltd. MagMaterials projected that the new ownership would make it easier to get finding from Chinese banks like the Export-Import Bank of China. Despite some challenges, the Republic of the Congo retains its strong economic growth with enormous investment potential. The country has considerable and varied natural resource wealth, a strategic location with an ISPS-certified port, a capital city across the river from the enormous DRC market, and a relative dearth of competition. The government is eager to support international investment and is also now largely debt-free.\n\nAs of 2012, seven mining permits have been granted:\n\n== Geology ==\nPrecambrian rocks of the Archean to Neoproterozoic Age form the central part of the Republic of the Congo, overlain by continental Cretaceous and Tertiary Sediments. The East is made up of Quaternary alluvial sedimentation. The Coastal basin is made up of Cretaceous to Quaternary marine sediments, including phosphatic sequences and evaporites. The Precambrian Mayombe Range boards the basin to the East. The Neoproterozoic West Congolian Supergroup occurs in the Nyanga syncline with feldspathic sediments overlain by dolomites, cherts and dolomitic limestone with stromatolites.\n\nAlluvial diamonds have been found, near the border with the Central African Republic border.\n\nA giant granitoid massif known as the Cahillu Massif extends with NS foliation through south-central Congo. At Mayoko a relict greenstone belt occurs, with sub-vertical banded iron formation. Two large high iron deposits have been located, Mayoko-Moussondji (Congo Mining) and Mayoko-Lekoumou (Exxaro). Iron is hosted within 'Chapeau de Fer' or hats of iron, a highly weathered iron-rich metamorphic rock with some parts covered by high-grade hematite crust.\n\nIron ore has also been discovered in the northwestern part of the Archaean Congo Craton (Sangha region), within the Chaillu Block. This is a metamorphosed complex of Tonalite- Trondhjemite-Granite gneisses in which linear belts of metavolcaniclastic rocks and BIF occur.\n\n== Mining code ==\nIn April 2005, the Republic of the Congo introduced a new Mining Code under Law4-2005. The new mining code offers attractive terms and establishes a clear regime from exploration and exploitation agreements. The mining code allows foreign entities to control mining operations. This represented the first major overhaul to the mining code since 1965.\n\nThe mining code also gives, upon granting a mining licence, the Congolese state a 10% non-contributing stake in all mining projects. The government has the right to purchase additional equity, but to date has never excised this right.\n\n== Royalties and taxes ==\nRoyalties are calculated on the export value of the resource based on the following schedule.\n\n== Company profit taxes ==\nArticle 98 of the Mining Code requires the state and the holder of an exploitation licence to enter into a mining agreement (“Convention”) with the Congolese government which clearly establishes the rights and obligations of each party, and grants concessions such as tax-free periods. Once an exploitation licence for the Project has been granted and following negotiation and cooperation of advisers, the licence holder and the government will agree the terms of the convention. The terms of the convention typically require the state to undertake, as soon as possible after signing the convention, to submit the convention to the Congolese Parliament for ratification and adoption as a state law (“Ratification Law”), and no later than three months from the date of its presentation to Parliament.\n\n== Oil and gas ==\nIn the late 1970s, Congo emerged as a significant oil producer, with production expanding considerably during the 1990s. However, by the turn of the century, production began to decline as existing oil fields reached maturity in 2001. However, since 2008 oil production has increased every year as a result of several new projects coming online, mainly Congo’s first deep-water field, Moho Bilondo. The Congo is the fifth largest oil producer in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nAccording to the 2012 BP Statistical Energy Survey, Congo had proved oil reserves of 1.94 billion barrels at the end of 2011, equivalent to 17.9 years of current production and 0.11% of the world's reserves. The accompanying downstream oil industry is an important element in the country's economy. The oil industry is predominantly run by foreign companies and is centred on the coastal city of Pointe Noire where the Congolaise de Raffinage (Coraf) operates the 21,000 bpd Pointe Noire refinery.

By 2000, gold and lime were the only minerals still being extracted.\n\n== 2000 onwards ==\nIn 2000 the government began to show a genuine commitment to developing a mining sector, and it is a central part of the country’s economic diversification program – Le Chemin d’Avenir (Path Forward).\n\nIn the past, the mining sector has been rife with corruption, which led to a suspension in 2004 of the RoC from the Kimberly Process. However, corruption has been significantly reduced and the ROC was later reinstated to the Kimberly Process after it made improvements in monitoring procedures for its mining sector.\n\nIn 2005, the government introduced a new mining code, to replace existing outdated legislation. The mining code offers prospective miners attractive and flexible terms to encourage the development of mining projects.\n\nTo support the economic diversification strategy, the government created four special economic zones, including the Pointe-Noire Special Economic Zone, located on the coast at Point Indienne, in support of developing petrochemical, iron and steel, and mining activities. In 2008 the Bureau d’Expertise, d’Evaluation et de Certification des Substances Minérales Précieuses (Bureau for Assay, Evaluation and Certification of Precious Minerals) was established with the aim of facilitating control over the scattered artisanal alluvial diamond extraction operations.\n\nSassou, the current president, has repeatedly stated he wants to build a lucrative mining industry, unlike that of the neighboring DRC, which is plagued by corruption and mismanagement. After the September 2009 elections the government formed the new Ministry of Mines and Geology, Ministère des Mines et de la Géologie, with Pierre Oba as Minister.\n\nIn early 2010, the Canadian exploration company NGEx Resources Inc was granted two exploration licences for copper-lead-zinc, over the Reneville and Kingouala areas.\n\nHanlong initiated a bid for Sundance Resources in July 2012. The bid initially valued Sundance at US$1.5 billion but was later revised to US$1.3 billion. Sundance's main asset is the Nabeba iron ore deposit, part of the Mbalam Project together with the Mbaraga deposit in neighbouring Cameroon. In February the National Development and Reform Commission of the People's Republic of China (NDRC) extended provisional approval of the bid to July 2013. On 8 April Sundance announced termination of the takeover bid after Hanlong failed to meet the funding conditions.\n\nIn December 2011, the Ministry of Mining and Geology was invited to London, to receive second place in the \"Country of the Year\" prize, after Liberia. In January of the following year, Exxaro made a US $349 million takeover offer for African Iron. In December 2012, the ministerial council approved the recommendation of the ministry for mines to grant the Nabeba mining permit.\n\nMagMinerals Inc., a division of MagIndustries Corp. of Canada, continued financing negotiations for the development of Mengo exploitation permit and the Kouilou potash processing facility. In February, TSC Capital Ltd. of Taiwan withdrew its offer to acquire up to 55% of MagIndustries. In April, Evergreen Resources Holding Ltd. of the United Kingdom, (a subsidiary of Evergreen Industries Holding Group Company, Ltd. of China), agree to acquire MagIndustries. The friendly takeover was completed in July. MagMinerals Inc., a division of MagIndustriesCorp). of Canada, continued negotiations to secure financing for the development of the Mengo exploitation permit and the Kouilou potash processing facility. In April, Evergreen Resources Holding Ltd. of the United Kingdom, a subsidiary of China's Evergreen Industries Holding Group Company, Ltd. MagMaterials projected that the new ownership would make it easier to get finding from Chinese banks like the Export-Import Bank of China. Despite some challenges, the Republic of the Congo retains its strong economic growth with enormous investment potential. The country has considerable and varied natural resource wealth, a strategic location with an ISPS-certified port, a capital city across the river from the enormous DRC market, and a relative dearth of competition. The government is eager to support international investment and is also now largely debt-free.\n\nAs of 2012, seven mining permits have been granted:\n\n== Geology ==\nPrecambrian rocks of the Archean to Neoproterozoic Age form the central part of the Republic of the Congo, overlain by continental Cretaceous and Tertiary Sediments. The East is made up of Quaternary alluvial sedimentation. The Coastal basin is made up of Cretaceous to Quaternary marine sediments, including phosphatic sequences and evaporites. The Precambrian Mayombe Range boards the basin to the East. The Neoproterozoic West Congolian Supergroup occurs in the Nyanga syncline with feldspathic sediments overlain by dolomites, cherts and dolomitic limestone with stromatolites.\n\nAlluvial diamonds have been found, near the border with the Central African Republic border.\n\nA giant granitoid massif known as the Cahillu Massif extends with NS foliation through south-central Congo. At Mayoko a relict greenstone belt occurs, with sub-vertical banded iron formation. Two large high iron deposits have been located, Mayoko-Moussondji (Congo Mining) and Mayoko-Lekoumou (Exxaro). Iron is hosted within 'Chapeau de Fer' or hats of iron, a highly weathered iron-rich metamorphic rock with some parts covered by high-grade hematite crust.\n\nIron ore has also been discovered in the northwestern part of the Archaean Congo Craton (Sangha region), within the Chaillu Block. This is a metamorphosed complex of Tonalite- Trondhjemite-Granite gneisses in which linear belts of metavolcaniclastic rocks and BIF occur.\n\n== Mining code ==\nIn April 2005, the Republic of the Congo introduced a new Mining Code under Law4-2005. The new mining code offers attractive terms and establishes a clear regime from exploration and exploitation agreements. The mining code allows foreign entities to control mining operations. This represented the first major overhaul to the mining code since 1965.\n\nThe mining code also gives, upon granting a mining licence, the Congolese state a 10% non-contributing stake in all mining projects. The government has the right to purchase additional equity, but to date has never excised this right.\n\n== Royalties and taxes ==\nRoyalties are calculated on the export value of the resource based on the following schedule.\n\n== Company profit taxes ==\nArticle 98 of the Mining Code requires the state and the holder of an exploitation licence to enter into a mining agreement (“Convention”) with the Congolese government which clearly establishes the rights and obligations of each party, and grants concessions such as tax-free periods. Once an exploitation licence for the Project has been granted and following negotiation and cooperation of advisers, the licence holder and the government will agree the terms of the convention. The terms of the convention typically require the state to undertake, as soon as possible after signing the convention, to submit the convention to the Congolese Parliament for ratification and adoption as a state law (“Ratification Law”), and no later than three months from the date of its presentation to Parliament.\n\n== Oil and gas ==\nIn the late 1970s, Congo emerged as a significant oil producer, with production expanding considerably during the 1990s. However, by the turn of the century, production began to decline as existing oil fields reached maturity in 2001. However, since 2008 oil production has increased every year as a result of several new projects coming online, mainly Congo’s first deep-water field, Moho Bilondo. The Congo is the fifth largest oil producer in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nAccording to the 2012 BP Statistical Energy Survey, Congo had proved oil reserves of 1.94 billion barrels at the end of 2011, equivalent to 17.9 years of current production and 0.11% of the world's reserves. The accompanying downstream oil industry is an important element in the country's economy. The oil industry is predominantly run by foreign companies and is centred on the coastal city of Pointe Noire where the Congolaise de Raffinage (Coraf) operates the 21,000 bpd Pointe Noire refinery. The refinery has been out of commission for four years and in 2013 had only recently resumed operations.\n\nCongo holds the fifth-largest proved reserves of natural gas in the Sub-Saharan Africa, at 3.2 Tcf, A majority of natural gas, around 65%, is re-injected and 21% flared.\"\"\""}

When civil war broke out, the subordinate Catholic governors of Provence, rallied to him instead of his father. With their backing, and an alliance with the militant Catholic partisans under Carcès he entered formal revolt against his father in May.

Biron recommended to the crown in April 1564 that the pair be summoned to court to answer for their actions.\n\nDespite his violent rebellion against his father, when Claude drew up his will, it would be Sommerive that inherited his titles. The elderly count would note 'the ingratitudes and disobedience of Honorat, our eldest son, whose youth and bad judgement pitted him against us, as everyone knows to our great regret and displeasure, which would justify disinheriting him if we wished to'.

He scored his first two goals with the team on October 18, 2011, against the Providence Bruins, and was second in team scoring with 45 points by the end of the season. He was recalled by the Islanders during the season, and made his NHL debut on February 24, 2012, against the New York Rangers. He appeared in 15 games with the Islanders that season and recorded four assists. His first two NHL points came on March 1, 2012, against the Philadelphia Flyers. After returning to the Sound Tigers, an upper body injury prevented him from playing in the team's last five games of the regular season, but he returned in time for the playoffs.\n\nAs a result of the 2012–13 NHL lockout, Cizikas began the season with the Sound Tigers. He had 21 points in 31 games with Bridgeport before the labour dispute was settled and he was recalled to the Islanders.

One doctor testified that Castillo's concussion was severe enough that it should have kept him out of competition with physical contact for a full year. The Castillo family supported Cizikas throughout his ordeal and believed the death to have been accidental, asking that Cizikas be spared punishment. Their request could not be met, however, because Peel Regional Police supported Cizikas' conviction, as the tackle led to a death. Castillo's father provided a statement that called for fighting in youth hockey to be abolished, but again did not blame Cizikas for his son's death.\n\nIn 2009, Cizikas was found guilty of manslaughter by Judge Bruce Duncan, who believed Cizikas used \"unnecessary force.\" He was given a sentence of one year probation and 100 hours of community service.", "src": "== Playing career ==\nThe Mississauga St. Michael's Majors selected Cizikas with their first selection, third overall, in the 2007 Ontario Hockey League (OHL) Priority Selection draft.

It was formed in 1850 at a tenant right convention called in Dublin by Charles Gavan Duffy, editor of the revived Young Irelander weekly The Nation; James MacKnight editor of the Londonderry Sentinel; Frederick Lucas, founder of the international Catholic weekly, The Tablet; and John Gray, owner of the leading nationalist paper, the Freeman's Journal''. Against the background of the distress caused by the Great Famine and by a fall in agricultural prices, Duffy believed that the demand for tenant rights could serve as the basis for a new all-Ireland movement and for a (potentially abstentionist) national party.\n\nThe Westminster elections of July 1852 returned 48 MPs, including Duffy from New Ross, pledged to the tenant cause. But what Duffy had projected as a \"League of North and South\" failed to deliver in Ulster. William Kirk from the border town of Newry was province's only tenant-right representative. In Monaghan, the Rev. David Bell was to find that of his 100 Presbyterian congregants who had signed the requisition asking John Gray to stand in their constituency only 11 voted for him. In Down, William Sharman Crawford, who as MP for Rochdale in England had been the author of a tenant right bill, had his meetings broken up by Orange vigilantes.\n\nAn early difficulty in appealing to Protestant tenants and voters in the north was the declared intention of many League-endorsed candidates to repeal the Ecclesiastical Titles Act 1851. Together with the presence among them of so many sitting Repeal Association MPs, their determination to remove the Act's restrictions on a restored Catholic Church hierarchy heightened the suspicion that the League was being used for political purposes beyond its declared agenda. In this, the prominent County Down tenant-righter, Julius McCullagh, argued the 1851 Act worked its purpose: to \"afresh old grudges and differences - to divide a people now happily uniting\". It was the case as well that landowners in the north threatened to withdraw their consent for the existing Ulster Custom if their Conservative nominees were not elected.\n\nIn November 1852, Lord Derby's short-lived Conservative ministry introduced a land bill to compensate Irish tenants on eviction for improvements they had made to the land. The Tenant Compensation Bill passed in the House of Commons in 1853 and 1854, but failed in the House of Lords. The bills had little impressed the League and its MPs as landlords would have been left free to pass on the costs of compensation through their still unrestricted freedom to raise rents.\n\nHolding the balance of power in the House of Commons, the Independent Irish MPs voted to bring down the government. But in the process two of the leading members, John Sadlier and William Keogh, broke their pledges of independent opposition and accepted positions in a new Whig-Peelite ministry of Lord Aberdeen. Twenty others followed as reliable supporters. While Aberdeen opposed to the Ecclesiastical Titles Act, his government gave no undertakings in regard to tenant-right policy Significantly in a League debate in February 1853 MacKnight, wary of any sign of Irish separatism, did not support Duffy in condemning these desertions.

This was accompanied by the defection from the League of the Catholic Defence Association (to their detractors, \"the Pope's Brass Band\"). Lucas's decision to take a complaint against Cullen to Rome further alienated clerical support.\n\nTo Duffy the cause of the Irish tenants, and indeed of Ireland generally, seemed more hopeless than ever. Broken in health and spirit, in 1855 he published a farewell address to his constituency, declaring that he had resolved to retire from parliament, as it was no longer possible to accomplish the task for which he had solicited their votes. To John Dillon he wrote that an Ireland where McKeogh typified patriotism and Cullen the church was an Ireland in which he could no longer live. In 1856 Duffy and his family emigrated to Australia.\n\nIn the 1857 general election, with a recovery in agricultural prices blunting the enthusiasm of farmers for agitation, those presenting themselves as Independent Irish managed to hold on to 13 seats.

The Independent Irish MPs had been under the notional leadership of George Henry Moore. Within the Catholic Church, Moore had retained sufficient support from Cullen's rival, Archbishop John MacHale of Tuam, for his reelection in 1857 to overturned in the House of Commons on the grounds of \"obtrusive\" and \"unseemly\" clerical influence.\n\nThe IIP never developed the organisation and leadership to get out their full vote in the Commons or to collect, when the opportunity arose, the support of other MPs.

The reforms involved large scale seizure and export of food corps from Manipur without consideration for local requirements which caused starvation at times of Mautam. It led to agitations by the women of the Ima Keithel and in response, the British attempted to sell off the assets and properties of Ima Keithel to foreigners and external buyers. This among other causes resulted in the Nupi Lan or the women's war, which eventually seized with the Japanese invasion of India.\n\nFollowing independence, the market regained prominence as a commercial center and a hub of socio-political discussions. In 2010, the market was moved into the Khawairamband Bazaar complex constructed by the Municipal Corporation of Imphal. The complex had sustained damaged in the 2016 Imphal earthquake which effected the livelihood of around 800 vendors.\n\n== Market ==\nThe Ima Keithel is located in the Khawairamband Bazaar Complex reconstructed on the site of Purana Bazaar in central Imphal. It is located west of Kangla Fort and on the Bir Tikendrajit Road in the Thangal Bazar locality. The complex consists of three large buildings with pagoda styled roofs. The market is split into two sections on either side of the road. Two buildings are located to the north of the main road and one to the south. The buildings are segregated into textile housing sections and household groceries sections. There is also a section of stalls under a large tin and tarp arrangement market to the east of the main buildings. In order to set up stalls in the main buildings of the market, an annual municipal fees is levied. The fee of a 16 square feet (1.5 m2) stall was ₹140,000 per annum at the time of construction in 2010. There is a licensing system in place for vendors with stalls. The market houses around 5000–6000 women vendors at any given day. As of 2017, the vendors at the market make an annual profit between ₹73,000 and ₹200,000. The annual turnover of the market was estimated to be between ₹40–50 Crore.\n\n== Management ==\nThe market is managed by a union of all the vendors of the market. It maintains a custom of only allowing women who have been married at least once to set up stalls. The women vendors include those who are divorced or have been widowed in the insurgency in Manipur. The vendors are primarily in the age of 45–70 years. The union also runs a credit system for lending to women traders.\"\"\""}

Bithynia also contained Nicaea, noted for being the birthplace of the Nicene Creed.\n\nAccording to Strabo, Bithynia was bounded on the east by the river Sangarius (modern Sakarya river), but the more commonly received division extended it to the Parthenius, which separated it from Paphlagonia, thus comprising the district inhabited by the Mariandyni. On the west and southwest it was separated from Mysia by the river Rhyndacus and on the south it adjoined Phrygia and Galatia.\n\nIt is occupied by mountains and forests, but has valleys and coastal districts of great fertility. The most important mountain range is the (so-called) \"Mysian\" Olympus (8000 ft., 2500 m), which towers above Bursa and is clearly visible as far away as Istanbul (70 miles, 113 km). Its summits are covered with snow for a great part of the year.\n\nEast of this the range extends for more than 100 miles (160 km), from the Sakarya to Paphlagonia. Both of these ranges are part of the border of mountains which bound the great tableland of Anatolia, Turkey. The broad tract which projects towards the west as far as the shores of the Bosporus, though hilly and covered with forests — the Turkish Ağaç Denizi, or \"The sea of Trees\" — is not traversed by any mountain chain. The west coast is indented by two deep inlets, the northernmost, the Gulf of İzmit (ancient Gulf of Astacus), penetrating between 40 and 50 miles (65–80 km) into the interior as far as İzmit (ancient Nicomedia), separated by an isthmus of only about 25 miles (40 km) from the Black Sea; and the Gulf of Mudanya or Gemlik (Gulf of Cius), about 25 miles (40 km) long. At its extremity is situated the small town of Gemlik (ancient Cius) at the mouth of a valley, communicating with the lake of Iznik, on which was situated Nicaea.\n\nThe principal rivers are the Sangarios which traverses the province from down to north; the Rhyndacus, which separated it from Mysia; and the Billaeus (Filyos), which rises in the Aladağ, about 50 miles (80 km) from the sea, and after flowing by modern Bolu (ancient Bithynion-Claudiopolis) falls into the Euxine, close to the ruins of the ancient Tium, about 40 miles (64 km) northeast of Heraclea Pontica (the modern Karadeniz Ereğli), having a course of more than 100 miles (160 km). The Parthenius (modern Bartın), the eastern boundary of the province, is a much less considerable stream.\n\nThe valleys towards the Black Sea abound in fruit trees of all kinds, such as oranges, while the valley of the Sangarius and the plains near Bursa and Iznik (Nicaea) are fertile and well cultivated. Extensive plantations of mulberry trees supply the silk for which Bursa has long been celebrated, and which is manufactured there on a large scale.\n\n== Iron Age ==\nBithynia is named for the Thracian tribe of the Bithyni, mentioned by Herodotus (VII.75) alongside the Thyni. The \"Thraco-Phrygian\" migration from the Balkans to Asia Minor would have taken place at some point following the Bronze Age collapse or during the early Iron Age. The Thyni and Bithyni appear to have settled simultaneously in the adjoining parts of Asia, where they expelled or subdued the Mysians, Caucones and other minor tribes, the Mariandyni maintaining themselves in the northeast. Herodotus mentions the Thyni and Bithyni as settling side by side. No trace of their original language has been preserved, but Herodotus describes them as related to the tribes of Thracian extraction like the Phrygians and Armenians, whose languages may form part of the Paleo-Balkan group (although this is not certain and the theory is not universally accepted).\n\nLater the Greeks established on the coast the colonies of Cius (modern Gemlik); Chalcedon (modern Kadıköy), at the entrance of the Bosporus, nearly opposite Byzantium (modern Istanbul) and Heraclea Pontica (modern Karadeniz Ereğli), on the Euxine, about 120 miles (190 km) east of the Bosporus.\n\nThe Bithynians were incorporated by king Croesus within the Lydian monarchy, with which they fell under the dominion of Persia (546 BC), and were included in the satrapy of Phrygia, which comprised all the countries up to the Hellespont and Bosporus.\n\n== Kingdom of Bithynia ==\nEven before the conquest by Alexander the Bithynians appear to have asserted their independence, and successfully maintained it under two native princes, Bas and Zipoites, the latter of whom assumed the title of king (basileus) in 297 BC.\n\nHis son and successor, Nicomedes I, founded Nicomedia, which soon rose to great prosperity, and during his long reign (c. 278 – c. 255 BC), as well as those of his successors, Prusias I, Prusias II and Nicomedes II (149 – 91 BC), the kingdom of Bithynia had a considerable standing and influence among the minor monarchies of Anatolia. But the last king, Nicomedes IV, was unable to maintain himself in power against Mithridates VI of Pontus. After being restored to his throne by the Roman Senate, he bequeathed his kingdom through his will to the Roman republic (74 BC).\n\nThe coinage of these kings show their regal portraits, which tend to be engraved in an extremely accomplished Hellenistic style.\n\n== Roman province ==\nAs a Roman province, the boundaries of Bithynia changed frequently.

The valley as such is delimited by Ladakh in the north, Lahaul and Kullu districts in the west and south-east respectively, and by Tibet and the Kinnaur district in the east. While Tabo village is in a bowl-shaped flat valley, the monastery is also in the bottom of the valley, unlike other monasteries in the valley, which are perched on hills; in the past the region was part of Tibet.It is located in a very arid, cold and rocky area at an altitude of 3,050 metres (10,010 ft). Above the monastery there are a number of caves carved into the cliff face and used by monks for meditation. There is also an assembly hall in the caves and some faded paintings on the rock face.\n\n== Early history ==\nThe monastery was built by the Buddhist king (also known as Royal Lama) Yeshe-Ö in 996 A.D. It was renovated 46 years later by the royal priest Jangchub O'd, the grandnephew of Yeshe-Ö. They were kings of the Purang-Guge kingdom whose ancestry is traced to the ancient Tibetan monarchy, and extended their kingdom from Ladakh to Mustang by building a large network of trade routes, and built temples along the route. Tabo was built as a 'daughter' monastery of the Tholing Monastery in Ngari, western Tibet. This royal dynasty was instrumental in re-introducing the Indian Mahayana Buddhism in Tibet, the second major spreading of Buddhism in Tibetan history. They contributed richly to the political, religious and economic institutions of Tibet in the 11th century through the building of Tabo Monastery; this is documented in the writing on the walls of Tabo.\n\nThe iconographic depictions are reported to be of 1042 and later, consisting of paintings, sculptures, inscriptions and extensive wall texts. The translator Rinchen Zangpo, a Tibetan lama from western Tibet, who was chiefly responsible for translating Sanskrit Buddhist texts into Tibetan, was the preceptor to King Yeshe-Ö who helped in the missionary activities. Several Indian pundits visited Tabo to learn the Tibetan language.\n\n== Late 17th to 19th centuries ==\nDuring the 17th-19th centuries, the monastery and the bridge across the Spiti River witnessed historical events and political turmoil in the area. Manuscripts such as Tabo Kanjur make mention of some violent confrontations. An inscription of 1837 records attacks on the Tabo Assembly Hall in 1837, which can also visually be seen by damages to some parts of the walls. The attack is attributed to 'Rinjeet's troops' who were under the kings of Ladakh. With the British Rule from 1846, the area enjoyed peace until the 1950s when the Indo-China border disputes reawakened the political claims of the border posts. In 1855, Tabo had 32 monks.\n\n== Modern era ==\nThe original monastery was severely damaged in the 1975 Kinnaur earthquake. Subsequent to its full restoration and the addition of new structures, the 14th Dalai Lama visited the monastery and initiated the Kalachakra Festival (a process of initiation and rejuvenation) in 1983, after the Kalachakra Temple was built. He also revisited in 1996 when the millennium of its existence was celebrated and has returned on numerous occasions. In 2009, the Dalai Lama was scheduled to inaugurate the Kalachakra Stupa, which has been built as an auspicious symbol, following the special blessings of Kalachakra he had performed earlier. Sakya Trizin and other Tibetan teachers and meditation masters have also visited the monastery and encouraged the Buddhist practice among the local people.\n\nThe monastery has 45 monks. Kyabje Serkong Tsenshap Rinpoche (1914-1983) served as the Head Lama prior to Geshe Sonam Wangdui, who became the Abbot of Tabo Monastery since 1975. His responsibilities include caring for the monastery and monks, teaching Buddhist scripture, and looking after the local community. Current Serkong Tsenshap Rinpoche is the spiritual head of the monastery.\n\nTabo is protected by the ASI as a national historic treasure of India. As such, ASI encourages heritage tourism to this site. ASI had also proposed this monastery, the only monolithic structure of its kind in North India, for recognition as a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its sanctity in Trans Himalayan Buddhism. In 2002, ASI carried out replacement of the large beam, 10 by 10 inches (250 mm × 250 mm), by 4 feet (1.2 m) in length, made of Deodar, which supported the roof of the main hall of the old monastery, with a Sal timber beam as Deodor of that size could not be located.\n\n== Architecture and fittings ==\nTabo Monastery (Tabo 'Chos-hKhor' or Doctrinal Enclave) now has nine temples, four decorated stupas, and cave shrines. The paintings date to the 10th-11th centuries for main temple (Tsug la Khang), 13th-14th centuries for the stupas, and from the 15th to the 20th centuries for all the other temples. Yeshe-Ö and his two sons when they built the monastery in 996 AD blended the provincial and regional characteristics with that of India and Central Asia. One particular feature mentioned in this regard is the iconographic themes of non-Buddhist traditions emanating from the protectress deity Wi-nyu-myin. The main temple is conjectured to represent the entire Vajradhatu Mandala.The monastery has a huge collection of manuscripts and Pramana texts, which were filmed between 1991 and 1998.\n\n== Main temple ==\nThe main temple has an entry hall (Go Khang), followed by an Assembly Hall (Du Khang). At the western end of the assembly hall there is an apse (recessed area), which has a cella or shrine area (Ti Tsang Khang) with an ambulatory (Kor lam Khang) passage.

The valley as such is delimited by Ladakh in the north, Lahaul and Kullu districts in the west and south-east respectively, and by Tibet and the Kinnaur district in the east. While Tabo village is in a bowl-shaped flat valley, the monastery is also in the bottom of the valley, unlike other monasteries in the valley, which are perched on hills; in the past the region was part of Tibet.It is located in a very arid, cold and rocky area at an altitude of 3,050 metres (10,010 ft). Above the monastery there are a number of caves carved into the cliff face and used by monks for meditation. There is also an assembly hall in the caves and some faded paintings on the rock face.\n\n== Early history ==\nThe monastery was built by the Buddhist king (also known as Royal Lama) Yeshe-Ö in 996 A.D. It was renovated 46 years later by the royal priest Jangchub O'd, the grandnephew of Yeshe-Ö. They were kings of the Purang-Guge kingdom whose ancestry is traced to the ancient Tibetan monarchy, and extended their kingdom from Ladakh to Mustang by building a large network of trade routes, and built temples along the route. Tabo was built as a 'daughter' monastery of the Tholing Monastery in Ngari, western Tibet. This royal dynasty was instrumental in re-introducing the Indian Mahayana Buddhism in Tibet, the second major spreading of Buddhism in Tibetan history. They contributed richly to the political, religious and economic institutions of Tibet in the 11th century through the building of Tabo Monastery; this is documented in the writing on the walls of Tabo.\n\nThe iconographic depictions are reported to be of 1042 and later, consisting of paintings, sculptures, inscriptions and extensive wall texts. The translator Rinchen Zangpo, a Tibetan lama from western Tibet, who was chiefly responsible for translating Sanskrit Buddhist texts into Tibetan, was the preceptor to King Yeshe-Ö who helped in the missionary activities. Several Indian pundits visited Tabo to learn the Tibetan language.\n\n== Late 17th to 19th centuries ==\nDuring the 17th-19th centuries, the monastery and the bridge across the Spiti River witnessed historical events and political turmoil in the area. Manuscripts such as Tabo Kanjur make mention of some violent confrontations. An inscription of 1837 records attacks on the Tabo Assembly Hall in 1837, which can also visually be seen by damages to some parts of the walls. The attack is attributed to 'Rinjeet's troops' who were under the kings of Ladakh. With the British Rule from 1846, the area enjoyed peace until the 1950s when the Indo-China border disputes reawakened the political claims of the border posts. In 1855, Tabo had 32 monks.\n\n== Modern era ==\nThe original monastery was severely damaged in the 1975 Kinnaur earthquake. Subsequent to its full restoration and the addition of new structures, the 14th Dalai Lama visited the monastery and initiated the Kalachakra Festival (a process of initiation and rejuvenation) in 1983, after the Kalachakra Temple was built. He also revisited in 1996 when the millennium of its existence was celebrated and has returned on numerous occasions. In 2009, the Dalai Lama was scheduled to inaugurate the Kalachakra Stupa, which has been built as an auspicious symbol, following the special blessings of Kalachakra he had performed earlier. Sakya Trizin and other Tibetan teachers and meditation masters have also visited the monastery and encouraged the Buddhist practice among the local people.\n\nThe monastery has 45 monks.

The temple has a new entry hall (Go Khang), which has paintings dated to the late 19th century or 20th century. The old entry hall, which originally formed the only part of the complex, has retained the paintings of 996 AD.\n\nThe Vajradhatu mandala is seen in the New Assembly Hall after entering from the old entry hall where the main deity of Vajradhatu, Vairocana (height 110 cm), is shown seated on a single lotus throne on the back wall. The main iconographic deities here are the Vajradhatu and life-size clay sculptures with painted decorations complementing the main theme. The mandala also has 32 life-size clay sculptures of other deities which are embedded to the wall which merge well within the painted environment. The Protector Deity, Dorje Chenmo, originally known as Wi-nyu-nin, of the main temple was venerated in this hall. The paintings are of very good quality with bright colours, and are dated to 15th or early 16th century. An inscription which brings out the details of renovation works done is fixed to the right of Vajrapasa image. The paintings are depicted in three sections with the central panel of the throne scene. The royal lama, Jangchub 'Od, who was in charge of the renovation, is painted here. On the left part of the composition 'the great Sangha of Tabo monastery' is depicted.\n\nThree very large life-size sculptures are located on a raised platform. They are within the shrine area of the temple. Each is flanked by a pair of painted goddesses. A seated Buddha figure sitting on a throne with the base sculpted with two lions facing each other is also seen; this is a partially restored image. The circumambulation of the temple performed by the devotees in a clock-wise fashion passes through the assembly hall. During this process, the narrative imagery on the south and adjacent walls, the pilgrimage of Sudhana, and on the north and adjacent walls, the Life of the Buddha are seen.\n\nThe main temple (Tsug la Khang) has the main hall and main assembly area. It also contains many scriptures written on wooden planks, which are hung on the walls. The dark main temple room is lit by a small sky window and hence the room appears dark. In the inner vestibule, there are colorful frescoes of Buddhist and Hindu-Buddhist gods. Next to the vestibule is the small room where garments for the ritual dances are kept. The main hall at the centre is studded with images, and at the centre is a Buddha image in the Lotus position. This image is flanked on either side by divine figures. On the pedestals next to the main image are many more brass images of Lamas. Tapestries cover the walls, doors and columns, and paintings of various Buddha incarnations, starting with Siddhartha and that of the Panchen Lamas, give it a divine atmosphere. About 50 clay images and full size busts of gods and demons are seen in the back wall of the main hall. The 108 holy scriptures are also part of the main hall display and weigh about 500 pounds.\n\n== Older temples ==\nThe Golden Temple (gSer-khang) is said to have been once covered with gold. It was renovated by Sengge Namgyal, a king of Ladakh in the 16th century. The walls and ceilings are covered with magnificent murals, which are well preserved and are dated to the 16th century. The other iconographic figures seen here are also found in other temples within the complex, and one such is of Vajradhara depiction.\n\nThe Bodhisattva Maitreya Temple (Byams-Pa Chen-po Lha-khang) is an ancient temple built in the first 100 years of the main monastery as testified by the wooden door frame. Remnants of a painting is attributed to the 14th century. According to the sketch in the Mandala Temple it is indicated that the Maitreya Temple was initially double storied, which is also confirmed by the damage to the entrance wall. The image of the Bodhisattva Maitreya here is over six metres (20 feet) high. There are also murals showing Tashilhunpo Monastery in Shigatse and the Potala in Lhasa. A carved stone column base has the figure of a lion.\n\nIn the Initiation Temple (dKyil-kHor- khang), there is a huge painting of Vairocana surrounded by eight Bodhisattvas. The other walls are covered in mandalas. This is where monks receive their initiations.\n\nThe Temple of Dromton or Trom-ton Temple (Brom-ston Lha khang) is thought to have been founded by Dromton (1008-1064 CE), one of the main disciples of Atisha. The Large Trom-ton Temple has murals of the eight Medicine Buddhas, which are dated to the 17th century; at the base of this temple the life of Shakyamuni Buddha is painted in a narrative form. The Small Mandala Temple is used for tantric rituals and teachings, may also be of the early period. The interior of the Small Trom-ton Temple has very elegant paintings; however, remnants of carvings, dates attributed to the 13th or 14th century, are discerned at the entry door to the temple. The Nun's Temple, a small temple, is seen on the back wall of the compound; the paintings here dated to 18th century are not of good quality.\n\n== Newer temples ==\nFive temples are included in the newer temple group, such as the Chamber of Picture Treasures (Z'al-ma) and the White Temple. (dKar-abyum Lha-Khang). After the assembly hall, the large Temple of Dromton (Brom-ston Lha khang) is the largest temple in the complex and contains many wall paintings; the wooden planks in the ceiling are decorated. The Mahakala Vajra Bhairava Temple (Gon-khang) contains the protective deity of the Gelukpa sect; it contains fierce deities and is only entered after protective meditation. The Protectress deity of the monastery along with her retinue are depicted on a large panel on the east wall of the main entrance; this painting was damaged due to water seepage and has been very well restored by ASI as it provides a link to the old history of Tabo Monastery.\n\n== Stupas ==\nThere are many stupas in the precincts of the temple complex of which four have paintings in its interior. Two of the stupas are dated to the 13th century, based on the paintings. A carved wooden lintel was also found in one of the stupas.\n\n== Fittings ==\nThe monastery is known as \"the Ajanta of the Himalayas\" because of its frescoes and stucco paintings. The iconography of this period in the temples also supports the bond that existed between the two cultures of India and Tibet. There is a large and priceless collection of thankas (scroll paintings), manuscripts, well-preserved statues, frescos and extensive murals which cover almost every wall. While in the earlier period, paintings in the interior of the main Tabo temple and its stupas represented the Nyingmapa, Kadampa and Sakyapa traditions, the later period represent paintings of the Gelugpa tradition. In the independent small chambers of the monastery, there are many paintings on the walls. The frescoes seen inside the gompa are in a fragile state. Some are of a bright cobalt colour. Prior to the 1975 earthquake, there were 32 raised medallions on the walls of the temple hall, and an image placed in front of each of them.\n\n== Grounds ==\nThe monastery has been built like a fort with very strong walls. The walls of these structures are 3 feet (0.91 m) in thickness and it is the reason for its survival over the centuries of depredations and natural calamities. The high mud brick wall which encloses some 6,300 square metres (68,000 sq ft). In addition to the temples, chortens, and monks' residence, there is an extension that houses the nuns' residence.\n\n== Features ==\nDaily worship starts with chantings at 6 AM, performed by the lamas who live in the new temple complex. The lamas also perform tantric rites here in the temples.\n\nTabo evolved as an important centre of learning in its early centuries; the Kadampa School developed into the Gelugpa School. The monastery currently runs the Serkong School, which was established on 29 May 1999, marking the 15th birthday of Serkong Tsenshap Rinpoche, the present abbot. There are 274 students, from the age of 5 to 14 years, in classes 1–8. The subjects covered are English, Hindi and Bhoti;, Social Science, Social Studies, Math and General Knowledge. Information technology, Sanskrit language and Art are also provided to students in higher grade levels. The Indian government funds about 50% of the school through a grant; the rest of the expenses are met through student fees and donations. The monastery has plans to enlarge the school's infrastructure and facilities but needs funding.\n\nMany festivals are held in the precincts of the monastery. The Tibetan monks perform traditional Buddhist and regional songs and dances. The most popular religious festival held here is the Chakhar Festival, which is dedicated to the peace and happiness of all. This is held every three years, usually during September or October. On this occasion, religious masked dances, songs and general festivities are the main events.\"\"\""}

At the time, Hartman was living in a mental health facility in Chicago's Near North Side.\n\nOn January 14, 2018, Hartman snuck onto a British Airways flight from Chicago O'Hare to London Heathrow; prosecutors said that she had walked past two TSA Precheck agents by using her hair to conceal her face. Hartman had failed the previous day to board a flight to Connecticut, but had stayed overnight at O'Hare. Not having a passport, British immigration officials sent her back to the U.S., where she was arrested and charged with theft. She pleaded guilty to one count of trespassing at an airport and the other charges were dismissed; Hartman was sentenced to 18 months' probation and mental health counseling, and was banned from being on any airport property without a valid ticket in her name.\n\nOn October 11, 2019, Hartman was arrested while trying to pass through security without a boarding pass or identification, again at O'Hare. At the time Hartman was still on probation from the London incident. She was detained at the Cook County Jail until 2020, when she was released from jail as part of initiatives to prevent the transmission of COVID-19.\n\nOn March 16, 2021, Hartman was arrested at O'Hare prior to reaching TSA checkpoints. She was detected after she left the transitional housing facility where she was staying and her electronic monitor triggered an alarm. She claimed she was compelled to flee to the airport when she became upset after an interview she had conducted with WBBM-TV had unexpectedly aired.\n\nOn March 3, 2022, Hartman pleaded guilty in Cook County Court to felony trespass and escape from electronic monitoring and was sentenced to two years and 18 months in prison for both charges, but she received credit for two years and five months already served. Prosecutors had dropped all other pending charges. In a statement, Hartman explained that she was \"happy to move on with my life.\"\n\n== Reaction ==\nIn March 2021, Chicago Tribune columnist Eric Zorn described Hartman's conduct as a \"sad story\" and that interviews with her revealed \"no hint of menace, but plenty of pathos, paranoia, and confusion.\" Zorn wrote that Hartman had revealed \"holes and vulnerabilities in airport security\" and that her case called for mental health treatment \"in a safe, therapeutic setting\" rather than imprisonment.\"\"\""}

{"id": 23948, "revid": "1116694221", "src_inf": "== Language and authorship ==\nTikunei haZohar is almost entirely in Aramaic, except for quotations from Tanakh that are used in building the lessons. The Aramaic of Tikunei haZohar differs somewhat from the Aramaic of the Talmud, and from the Aramaic of the rest of the Zohar.\n\nBy Tikunei haZohar's own account, the book was composed by Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and his son Rabbi Elazar (see the story of their hiding in the cave, below), with contribution from the soul of Ra`aya Meheimna (The Faithful Shepherd, i.e. Moshe) and from Eliyahu, of blessed memory; and with help from the souls of Tzadikim, headed by the soul of Adam haRishon and several Sabbas (\"Elders\") who came from Gan Eden to reveal new secrets of the Torah to Rabbi Shimon and his \"Chevraya Kadisha\" (\"Holy Friends\"). This accords with the text of Tikunei haZohar having a somewhat different a dialect from—and much less stylistic variation than—the rest of the Zohar, which according to tradition was compiled by Rabbi Shimon but includes earlier sources and contains additions by later generations.\n\nTikunei haZohar contains some additions from later Kabbalists, at least in the introductions. For example, Rabbi Shalom Buzaglo in his commentary Kisse Melekh p. 1a, explains an exclamation in the text that was inserted by the Arizal (see below).\n\nThe Zohar Chadash (parashat ki tavo, daf 73a) states that because no human knew the hiding place of Rabbi Shimon and his son, the Chevraya Kadisha would send notes to Rabbi Shimon with their questions by means of a dove, and he would reply to them the same way, via the dove. Rabbi Shimon was distressed that there was nobody to reveal the secrets of the Torah to the Chevraya Kadisha, and therefore when he went out from the cave he began to reveal to them secrets of the Torah, part of which is the book Tikunei haZohar.\n\nA translation into Hebrew of Tikunei haZohar and of the Zohar itself is the work Matok miDvash (מתוק מדבש) by the Jerusalem kabbalist Rabbi Daniel Frisch (1935–2005). It is written in common language, with simple explanations, in order to make the book accessible to a wider audience. It appears printed in some editions alongside or below the Zohar.\n\n== Structure, Composition, and Topics ==\nThere are two introductions. The first introduction, pages 1a-16b, tells how the book developed after Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and his son fled from the Romans and hid in a cave; describes the Ten Sefirot according to their colors; tells the loftiness of the Tzadikim; gives some explanations of the seventy Tikkunim; and also tells eleven additional tikkunim:\n\nThe intro goes on to discuss more concepts regarding the book, interspersed with prayers.\n\nThe second introduction, pages 17a-17b, contains a similar account of flight to the cave etc., followed by Patach Eliyahu. Patach Eliyahu is Eliyahu's meditative prayer which contains foundations of Kabbalah, namely, that Hashem is one and indivisible, Creator of all, beyond comprehension, but Who reveals Himself to us by the Torah and the Kabbalah and conducts the world by orders such as the ten Sefirot, which correspond to the human form—though He Himself has no body or form. Eliyahu concludes his prayer, saying to Rabbi Shimon, \"Arise, Rabbi Shimon, and let words of novellae be revealed by you, for behold, you have permission to reveal hidden secrets, through you; such permission to reveal has not been given to any human until now.\" Patach Eliyahu is found in the daily liturgy of Sefardic Jews, and in the daily or weekly liturgy of various Chasidim. Tiqqunei ha-Zohar, 17a-b, Petaḥ Eliyahu in full:\n\nAs an example of some of the permutations of בראשית/Bereishit which underlie the seventy Tikunim, Tikun #1 begins by explaining \"בראשית\" as \"ב' ראשית,\" (lit., beit [is] the \"heading\"), as in, \"This is the gate to Hashem; the righteous shall enter into it\" (Ps. 118:2) - \"the righteous have permission to enter in it [namely the Torah, Hashem's treasury], but the others who are not righteous are rejected from it.\" Tikun #2 explains \"בראשית\" as containing \"יראת\" (reverence [of]) and \"שב\" (return; repent); \"the allusion is to return with reverence [of God]; without reverence, there can be no wisdom...\" Tikun #3 mentions that \"בראשית\" contains \"ברית אש/brit esh/Covenant [of] fire\"—whoever guards the Covenant (i.e. circumcision, family purity and related matters) is saved from the fire of hell; and whoever is involved in Torah and guards the Covenant is called an \"adam/man\" fit to \"sit\" in the house (Isa. 44:13) and \"see\" the \"ראש בית/rosh bayit/Head of the House,\" that is, the King, Hashem.\n\nCertain passages of Tiqqunei ha-Zohar quote from the body of the Zohar, interpreting and developing it:\n\nThis page develops the account of creation with the Hebrew alphabet found in Zohar 1:2b-3b:\n\n== Regarding the Title, \"Tikunim/Repairs\" ==\nRegarding the character and purpose of the book, and chiefly regarding its name \"Tikunim,\" wrote Rabbi Shalom Buzaglo:\n\nComparison with the Zohar Rabbi Nachman of Breslov was involved with Tikunei haZohar more than with any other book, and he stated that Tikunei haZohar is of such different holiness and wisdom that it is beyond compare to the rest of the holy Zohar. He also said that, \"Concerning the book Tikunei haZohar, one thousand books would not suffice to explain the secrets that are to be found there.\"\n\nRabbi Tzvi Hirsh of Zidichov reckons that Tikunei haZohar is so called because\n\nAnother reason why it is called \"Tikunim\" is given by Rabbi Zadok HaKohen of Lublin, who wrote, \"Rashbi revealed and opened seventy faces that are in the word Bereishit, and called them Tikunei haZohar, because it is a term for light (אור, ohr); ohr is gematria of raz, which is the hidden light that the Holy One, Blessed is He, hid in the Torah, etc., by means of which it would be in the ability of the man to repair all that transpired upon him via teshuvah [repentance; return to God]...\"\n\n== Commentaries ==\nThere are several explanations and commentaries on Tikunei haZohar. The more noted ones include: Kisse Melekh by Rabbi Shalom Buzaglo, Ohr Yisrael by Rabbi Yisrael of Koznitz, Biurei haGra on Tikunei Zohar (Vilna, Jewish year 5627), Chemdat Tzvi by Rabbi Tzvi Hirsh, Be'er Yitzchak by Rabbi Yitzchak Aizik of Polotsk, Be'er Lechai Ro'i by Rabbi Tzvi Hirsh Shapira of Dinov [Dynow], Kegan haYarak by Rabbi Kalfa Guedj, Netzutzei Zohar by Rav Reuven Margoliot, Metok Medvash by Rav Daniel Frisch, and the Sulam by Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag.\n\n== Customs and influences ==\nThere is a Jewish custom to study Tikunei haZohar especially in the month of Elul, and also during the Ten Days of Repentance, since according to the kabbalists (including the Arizal) and many chasidic books, Tikunei haZohar repairs a person's spirit and cleanses his body and soul; therefore according to tradition, during these days which are called yemei teshuvah (days of repentance or drawing close to God), the repair of deeds is much greater. In some printed versions there is a partitioning of Tikunei haZohar over the forty days from the eve of Rosh Chodesh Elul to Yom Kippur, but this partitioning is not obligatory.

The Aramaic of Tikunei haZohar differs somewhat from the Aramaic of the Talmud, and from the Aramaic of the rest of the Zohar.\n\nBy Tikunei haZohar's own account, the book was composed by Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and his son Rabbi Elazar (see the story of their hiding in the cave, below), with contribution from the soul of Ra`aya Meheimna (The Faithful Shepherd, i.e. Moshe) and from Eliyahu, of blessed memory; and with help from the souls of Tzadikim, headed by the soul of Adam haRishon and several Sabbas (\"Elders\") who came from Gan Eden to reveal new secrets of the Torah to Rabbi Shimon and his \"Chevraya Kadisha\" (\"Holy Friends\"). This accords with the text of Tikunei haZohar having a somewhat different a dialect from—and much less stylistic variation than—the rest of the Zohar, which according to tradition was compiled by Rabbi Shimon but includes earlier sources and contains additions by later generations.\n\nTikunei haZohar contains some additions from later Kabbalists, at least in the introductions. For example, Rabbi Shalom Buzaglo in his commentary Kisse Melekh p. 1a, explains an exclamation in the text that was inserted by the Arizal (see below).\n\nThe Zohar Chadash (parashat ki tavo, daf 73a) states that because no human knew the hiding place of Rabbi Shimon and his son, the Chevraya Kadisha would send notes to Rabbi Shimon with their questions by means of a dove, and he would reply to them the same way, via the dove. Rabbi Shimon was distressed that there was nobody to reveal the secrets of the Torah to the Chevraya Kadisha, and therefore when he went out from the cave he began to reveal to them secrets of the Torah, part of which is the book Tikunei haZohar.\n\nA translation into Hebrew of Tikunei haZohar and of the Zohar itself is the work Matok miDvash (מתוק מדבש) by the Jerusalem kabbalist Rabbi Daniel Frisch (1935–2005). It is written in common language, with simple explanations, in order to make the book accessible to a wider audience. It appears printed in some editions alongside or below the Zohar.\n\n== Structure, Composition, and Topics ==\nThere are two introductions. The first introduction, pages 1a-16b, tells how the book developed after Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai and his son fled from the Romans and hid in a cave; describes the Ten Sefirot according to their colors; tells the loftiness of the Tzadikim; gives some explanations of the seventy Tikkunim; and also tells eleven additional tikkunim:\n\nThe intro goes on to discuss more concepts regarding the book, interspersed with prayers.\n\nThe second introduction, pages 17a-17b, contains a similar account of flight to the cave etc., followed by Patach Eliyahu. Patach Eliyahu is Eliyahu's meditative prayer which contains foundations of Kabbalah, namely, that Hashem is one and indivisible, Creator of all, beyond comprehension, but Who reveals Himself to us by the Torah and the Kabbalah and conducts the world by orders such as the ten Sefirot, which correspond to the human form—though He Himself has no body or form. Eliyahu concludes his prayer, saying to Rabbi Shimon, \"Arise, Rabbi Shimon, and let words of novellae be revealed by you, for behold, you have permission to reveal hidden secrets, through you; such permission to reveal has not been given to any human until now.\" Patach Eliyahu is found in the daily liturgy of Sefardic Jews, and in the daily or weekly liturgy of various Chasidim. Tiqqunei ha-Zohar, 17a-b, Petaḥ Eliyahu in full:\n\nAs an example of some of the permutations of בראשית/Bereishit which underlie the seventy Tikunim, Tikun #1 begins by explaining \"בראשית\" as \"ב' ראשית,\" (lit., beit [is] the \"heading\"), as in, \"This is the gate to Hashem; the righteous shall enter into it\" (Ps. 118:2) - \"the righteous have permission to enter in it [namely the Torah, Hashem's treasury], but the others who are not righteous are rejected from it.\" Tikun #2 explains \"בראשית\" as containing \"יראת\" (reverence [of]) and \"שב\" (return; repent); \"the allusion is to return with reverence [of God]; without reverence, there can be no wisdom...\" Tikun #3 mentions that \"בראשית\" contains \"ברית אש/brit esh/Covenant [of] fire\"—whoever guards the Covenant (i.e. circumcision, family purity and related matters) is saved from the fire of hell; and whoever is involved in Torah and guards the Covenant is called an \"adam/man\" fit to \"sit\" in the house (Isa. 44:13) and \"see\" the \"ראש בית/rosh bayit/Head of the House,\" that is, the King, Hashem.\n\nCertain passages of Tiqqunei ha-Zohar quote from the body of the Zohar, interpreting and developing it:\n\nThis page develops the account of creation with the Hebrew alphabet found in Zohar 1:2b-3b:\n\n== Regarding the Title, \"Tikunim/Repairs\" ==\nRegarding the character and purpose of the book, and chiefly regarding its name \"Tikunim,\" wrote Rabbi Shalom Buzaglo:\n\nComparison with the Zohar Rabbi Nachman of Breslov was involved with Tikunei haZohar more than with any other book, and he stated that Tikunei haZohar is of such different holiness and wisdom that it is beyond compare to the rest of the holy Zohar. He also said that, \"Concerning the book Tikunei haZohar, one thousand books would not suffice to explain the secrets that are to be found there.\"\n\nRabbi Tzvi Hirsh of Zidichov reckons that Tikunei haZohar is so called because\n\nAnother reason why it is called \"Tikunim\" is given by Rabbi Zadok HaKohen of Lublin, who wrote, \"Rashbi revealed and opened seventy faces that are in the word Bereishit, and called them Tikunei haZohar, because it is a term for light (אור, ohr); ohr is gematria of raz, which is the hidden light that the Holy One, Blessed is He, hid in the Torah, etc., by means of which it would be in the ability of the man to repair all that transpired upon him via teshuvah [repentance; return to God]...\"\n\n== Commentaries ==\nThere are several explanations and commentaries on Tikunei haZohar. The more noted ones include: Kisse Melekh by Rabbi Shalom Buzaglo, Ohr Yisrael by Rabbi Yisrael of Koznitz, Biurei haGra on Tikunei Zohar (Vilna, Jewish year 5627), Chemdat Tzvi by Rabbi Tzvi Hirsh, Be'er Yitzchak by Rabbi Yitzchak Aizik of Polotsk, Be'er Lechai Ro'i by Rabbi Tzvi Hirsh Shapira of Dinov [Dynow], Kegan haYarak by Rabbi Kalfa Guedj, Netzutzei Zohar by Rav Reuven Margoliot, Metok Medvash by Rav Daniel Frisch, and the Sulam by Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag.\n\n== Customs and influences ==\nThere is a Jewish custom to study Tikunei haZohar especially in the month of Elul, and also during the Ten Days of Repentance, since according to the kabbalists (including the Arizal) and many chasidic books, Tikunei haZohar repairs a person's spirit and cleanses his body and soul; therefore according to tradition, during these days which are called yemei teshuvah (days of repentance or drawing close to God), the repair of deeds is much greater. In some printed versions there is a partitioning of Tikunei haZohar over the forty days from the eve of Rosh Chodesh Elul to Yom Kippur, but this partitioning is not obligatory.

It remains at a high elevation for several more miles, through what was once one of New York's major oil fields. Afterwards, NY 16 then begins to drop through a narrow valley to cross the Allegheny River and enter its first major community, the city of Olean (which, like several other communities in the region, takes its name from oil). It crosses the city as Union Street, intersecting its first state highway, NY 417, at State Street. Here, ownership and maintenance of NY 16 shifts to the city for six blocks before becoming state-maintained once more at the point where North Union Street heads northwest to serve North Olean.\n\nA mile (1.6 km) north of NY 417, NY 16 reaches a bridge over Olean Creek, a tributary of the Allegheny. On the other side, it becomes a four-lane road with a divider as it approaches NY 17, currently concurrent with I-86 pending the entire expressway's upgrade to Interstate Highway standards. A trumpet interchange provides access to I-86 and NY 17 in both directions in the vicinity of Baldwin Heights. But NY 16 runs parallel to the freeway and remains a four-lane route, although no longer divided, following the Olean valley. At Hinsdale it finally does cross I-86/NY 17. Shortly afterwards, in the hamlet of Maplehurst, NY 446, the former route of NY 408, comes in from the east and terminates.\n\nNY 16 now follows the narrow valley of Ischua Creek, one of the Olean's tributaries, north past the road to the city's airport, in the town of Ischua, north to Franklinville. NY 98 joins NY 16 just south of the village and leaves north of it. NY 16 continues to Machias and the eastern end of NY 242. The highway veers to the northeast in Machias, turning back to the north at the resort hamlet of Lime Lake. A straight course takes the highway from this junction through the village of Delevan and to the Cattaraugus Creek bridge. This bridge heads into Erie County.\n\n== Erie County ==\nIn the southeastern corner of the county, NY 16 intersects with NY 39. NY 16 then begins heading slightly northwestward through a wider, more developed valley in the towns of Holland and Wales to the first sign of an approaching major metropolitan area, the south end of NY 400, the Aurora Expressway. After joining the expressway for two miles (3 km), it again leaves to become a two-lane that enters East Aurora as Olean Street. At the intersection with Main Street, NY 16 turns left and briefly joins with U.S. Route 20A (US 20A) and NY 78. US 20A leaves the two state routes behind at a fork at the village's east end, leaving NY 16 and NY 78 to head to the northwest again as Buffalo Street. At this point, NY 16 and NY 78 become county-maintained for the next 6.5 miles (10.5 km) as the unsigned County Route 572 (CR 572). At Willardshire Road as the highway passes the industrial parks and other facilities associated with local company Moog Inc. North of the village, it enters the Town of Elma and becomes Seneca Street, the name it will retain all the way to the city.\n\nNY 78 takes on its best-known name as well when it leaves at Transit Road (US 20), as NY 16 assumes an east–west heading across the suburban neighborhoods of West Seneca. It crosses NY 277, a major retail strip, at Union Road in the hamlet of Ebenezer. One final trumpet exit to NY 400 (and by extension, the New York State Thruway) precedes its junction with Harlem Road (NY 240), where county maintenance of NY 16, and thus the overlap with CR 572, ends. Just west of NY 240, NY 16 crosses the Thruway itself as it begins to head to the northwest and enter the city of Buffalo, where the route is locally maintained. Running almost due northwest through the residential neighborhoods of South Buffalo, NY 16 reaches its last major junction, with US 62, at Bailey Avenue just after crossing the Buffalo River. Immediately afterwards it crosses I-190 with no exit (but with northbound access) and returns to a more east–west course through industrial areas before ending at Main Street, NY 5, in the city center.\n\n== History ==\nThe portion of modern NY 16 between Hinsdale and Buffalo was originally designated as Route 17, an unsigned legislative route, by the New York State Legislature in 1908. At the same time, the segment of what is now NY 16 from Olean to Hinsdale was included in Route 4, a lengthy east–west route that extended from Lake Erie in Chautauqua County to the Hudson River in Orange County. The portion from Olean south to the state line was part of the old \"Kittanning Road,\" a road constructed by the Continental Army during the 1779 Sullivan Expedition that connected Kittanning, Pennsylvania to the Allegheny River; the road is among the oldest roads in the region.\n\nWhen the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, much of Route 4—including the Olean–Hinsdale segment—was designated as NY 17 while legislative Route 17 became part of NY 16, which began in Olean and overlapped with NY 17 along former legislative Route 4 between Olean and Hinsdale.\n\nIn the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY 17 was realigned between Olean and Wellsville to follow modern NY 417, eliminating its overlap with NY 16. By the following year, NY 16 was extended south to the Pennsylvania state line near Portville via NY 17 and what is now NY 305. The modern routing of NY 16 between Pennsylvania and Olean was designated as NY 16A c. 1932. The alignments of both NY 16 and NY 16A remained the same until August 1962 when NY 16A was supplanted by a rerouted NY 16. The former routing of NY 16 between the Pennsylvania state line and NY 17 became an extension of NY 305.\n\nThe portion of the Aurora Expressway (NY 400) between East Aurora and South Wales was completed in the early 1970s. NY 16 was rerouted to follow the new highway for two miles (3 km) before exiting the freeway and returning to its previous alignment. The former routing of NY 16 in the area, a 2.24-mile (3.60 km) long portion of Olean Road, is now NY 951V, an unsigned reference route.", "src": "== Cattaraugus County ==\nWhen PA 646 becomes NY 16 at the state line, it is already at a very high elevation on a ridgecrest, and at a rise two miles (3.2 km) into New York, it reaches 2,386 feet (727 m) in elevation, making it the highest state highway in western New York and among the highest in the state. It remains at a high elevation for several more miles, through what was once one of New York's major oil fields. Afterwards, NY 16 then begins to drop through a narrow valley to cross the Allegheny River and enter its first major community, the city of Olean (which, like several other communities in the region, takes its name from oil). It crosses the city as Union Street, intersecting its first state highway, NY 417, at State Street. Here, ownership and maintenance of NY 16 shifts to the city for six blocks before becoming state-maintained once more at the point where North Union Street heads northwest to serve North Olean.\n\nA mile (1.6 km) north of NY 417, NY 16 reaches a bridge over Olean Creek, a tributary of the Allegheny. On the other side, it becomes a four-lane road with a divider as it approaches NY 17, currently concurrent with I-86 pending the entire expressway's upgrade to Interstate Highway standards. A trumpet interchange provides access to I-86 and NY 17 in both directions in the vicinity of Baldwin Heights. But NY 16 runs parallel to the freeway and remains a four-lane route, although no longer divided, following the Olean valley. At Hinsdale it finally does cross I-86/NY 17. Shortly afterwards, in the hamlet of Maplehurst, NY 446, the former route of NY 408, comes in from the east and terminates.\n\nNY 16 now follows the narrow valley of Ischua Creek, one of the Olean's tributaries, north past the road to the city's airport, in the town of Ischua, north to Franklinville. NY 98 joins NY 16 just south of the village and leaves north of it. NY 16 continues to Machias and the eastern end of NY 242. The highway veers to the northeast in Machias, turning back to the north at the resort hamlet of Lime Lake. A straight course takes the highway from this junction through the village of Delevan and to the Cattaraugus Creek bridge. This bridge heads into Erie County.\n\n== Erie County ==\nIn the southeastern corner of the county, NY 16 intersects with NY 39. NY 16 then begins heading slightly northwestward through a wider, more developed valley in the towns of Holland and Wales to the first sign of an approaching major metropolitan area, the south end of NY 400, the Aurora Expressway. After joining the expressway for two miles (3 km), it again leaves to become a two-lane that enters East Aurora as Olean Street. At the intersection with Main Street, NY 16 turns left and briefly joins with U.S. Route 20A (US 20A) and NY 78. US 20A leaves the two state routes behind at a fork at the village's east end, leaving NY 16 and NY 78 to head to the northwest again as Buffalo Street. At this point, NY 16 and NY 78 become county-maintained for the next 6.5 miles (10.5 km) as the unsigned County Route 572 (CR 572). At Willardshire Road as the highway passes the industrial parks and other facilities associated with local company Moog Inc. North of the village, it enters the Town of Elma and becomes Seneca Street, the name it will retain all the way to the city.\n\nNY 78 takes on its best-known name as well when it leaves at Transit Road (US 20), as NY 16 assumes an east–west heading across the suburban neighborhoods of West Seneca. It crosses NY 277, a major retail strip, at Union Road in the hamlet of Ebenezer. One final trumpet exit to NY 400 (and by extension, the New York State Thruway) precedes its junction with Harlem Road (NY 240), where county maintenance of NY 16, and thus the overlap with CR 572, ends. Just west of NY 240, NY 16 crosses the Thruway itself as it begins to head to the northwest and enter the city of Buffalo, where the route is locally maintained.

Parks later gets up on the stage and performs the song as everyone in the audience is dancing, with the newly transformed A.N.T.s reversed backed to their ghoulish form.\n\nThe song was also used in \"Beam It Up\", the second-season Halloween-themed episode of the Disney Channel series Shake It Up (October 9, 2011). Gabby Duran & the Unsittables' Kylie Cantrall performed the song on the Halloween-themed episode \"You Decide LIVE!\" of the series Just Roll with It on October 4, 2019.\n\n== Composition ==\n\"Calling All the Monsters\" is predominantly a dance-pop and electropop song that runs through a club beat, at 142 BPM. It has been noted to be a modern version of Michael Jackson's 1982 song \"Thriller\". The sound of \"Calling All the Monsters\" received comparisons to the musical stylings of Jackson and singer Britney Spears. The theme of this song centers around magic and fantasy while the lyrics pertain to dancing with characters of a frightful nature.\n\n== Reception ==\nJessica Dawson of Commonsensemedia, the website that rates music for parents approval for children's listening, rated the song three out of five stars, praising its club-friendly nature, further commenting that \"McClain does a good job channeling the King of Pop in her own version of a dance-off with mummies and zombies, but she does it with a smile and a pink-sequined top. \"Calling All the Monsters\" is an upbeat, contagious club beat that will have you and your kids ready to kick it on the dance floor on Halloween night. Kids will love it for any night of the year, of course, but it's sure to be a hit when the little vampires and witches come out in October.\"\n\n\"Calling All the Monsters\" debut on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 100, moving 25,000 digital downloads during the week ending October 9, 2011. The release of the soundtrack prompted a sales increase for the song, reappearing on the chart at number eighty-six. The song earned 25,000 downloads within its first week of release.\n\n== Music video ==\nThe music video was released on September 21, 2011. China Anne McClain's older sisters, Lauryn Alisa McClain and Sierra Aylina McClain, guest star in the music video. The three sisters are in costume and looking for the location of a Halloween party. They are standing in front of a house where China thinks the party is happening. She goes inside despite the protests of her sisters. China takes her costume hood off and sees a suit of armor covered in spider webs that comes to life and they dance. She comes to the second floor and dances with more monsters, including a mummy, a werewolf and a Frankenstein's monster. A picture of a man in a frame moves and dances. She moves to the third floor, where a bunch of monsters dance with her in a giant ballroom. In the end, she comes out with her hood, saying to her sisters that there wasn't anything in there.\n\nThe video was inspired by the music videos \"Thriller\" (1983), by Michael Jackson, and \"Superstition\" (2003), by Raven-Symoné.\n\n== A.N.T. Farm ==\nLater on October 11, 2011 \"Calling All the Monsters\" was released alongside \"Dynamite\" on A.N.T. Farm with new songs and other songs that were featured on the TV series.\n\n== Cover Version ==\nAmber Pacific performed a cover for Cleopatra Records 2019 release, \"Punk Rock Halloween, Vol. 2: Louder, Faster & Scarier.\"\"\"\""}

The queen orders two royal servants (Mahinda Pathirage and Mahendra Perera) to take the statue to all other countries and find a woman who looks like the statue. After a long, unsuccessful search, the two royal servants arrive at Madura city, the capital of the Madura kingdom, during the season of the spring festival. Madura is a state under the control of Okkaka's empire. They place the statue near the river. Then the nanny of the royal family of Madura kingdom, Kudi (A hunchbacked woman) (Chandani Seneviratne), comes there and slaps the statue because she recognized the sculpture as the Princess Pabawathie (Pooja Umashankar), the daughter of King Madu (Palitha Silva), the king of Madura Kingdom and his queen (Kusum Renu).

The traditional spring meetings held by the DPG each year at venues across the country are among largest physics conferences in Europe, attended by around 10,000 experts from Germany and abroad. Fostering young talent is another central concern of the DPG: its conferences provide a platform particularly for younger scientists. The conferences provide students with opportunities to meet renowned scientists in person. The DPG also runs a nationwide network for physics students in the working group Young DPG. Female physicists have a forum of their own in the annual German Conference of Women in Physics.\n\n== Awards and school projects ==\nThe DPG honours outstanding achievements in physics with awards of international repute. The highest awards which are presented by the DPG are the Max Planck Medal for work in theoretical physics, first awarded in 1929, and the Stern–Gerlach Medal for work in experimental physics, first awarded in 1933. Some awards, such as the Gustav Hertz Prize for Young Physicists, intend to foster young talent. Others are awarded by the DPG in cooperation with other organisations in Germany and abroad, such as the Max Born Medal and Prize or the Otto Hahn Prize. The Medal for Natural Science Journalism is awarded by the DPG to personalities who have made a special contribution to bringing scientific facts to the attention of the general public. In addition, the DPG awards prizes to school graduates throughout the country for outstanding achievements in physics. It supports competitions for school students such as the Jugend forscht (national research contest for young scientists), promotes innovative school projects and organises advanced training courses for teaching staff.\n\n== Young Scientist Award for Socio- and Econophysics ==\nSince 2002, the Fachverband Physik sozio-ökonomischer Systeme (Physics of Socio-Economic Systems Division) recognizes \"outstanding original contributions that use physical methods to develop a better understanding of socio-economic problems\". Awardees are Vittoria Colizza (2013), Arne Traulsen (2012), Santo Fortunato (2011), Dirk Brockmann (2010), Duncan Watts (2009), Fabrizio Lillo (2008), Katarzyna Sznajd-Weron (2007) for the Sznajd model, Xavier Gabaix (2006), Reuven Cohen (2005), Illes Farkas (2004), Vasliki Plerou (2002) and Damien Challet (2002).\n\n== Publications ==\nThe DPG produces a range of various publications. The membership journal of the DPG Physik Journal provides news reports from the DPG and about physics in general. Besides, the DPG joins forces with the British Institute of Physics to publish the electronic open access journal New Journal of Physics. The articles published here have gone through a strict peer review in line with the stringent scientific quality standards propounded by the New Journal of Physics. Moreover, the DPG also publishes its conference programme every year under the name Verhandlungen der DPG (Programme Booklets for DPG Conferences), listing the abstracts of around 8,000 papers. And the web portal www.welt-der-physik.de, operated jointly by the DPG and the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), provides much information about physics even for nonexperts.\n\n== Historical publications ==\nPublications of the DPG have included:\n\nFrom the time of its creation in 1845, the DPG published Fortschritte der Physik and its Verhandlungen, but by 1919, the Verhandlungen had become too voluminous, so DPG chairman Arnold Sommerfeld formed a committee consisting of Albert Einstein, Eugen Goldstein, Fritz Haber, E. Jahnke, Karl Scheel, and Wilhelm Westphal, which recommended that a new journal, the Zeitschrift für Physik, should be established for rapid publication of original research articles by established scientists without peer review; it began publication the following year. In 1975 Zeitschrift für Physik was merged with Physics of Condensed Matter (ISSN 0340-2347). Zeitschrift für Physik was published as a 4-part journal from 1920–1997 by Springer-Verlag under the auspices of the DPG. During the early 20th century, it was considered one of the most prestigious journals in physics, with its golden years coinciding with the golden years of quantum mechanics. It was the vehicle used by those with avant-garde views and the young generation of quantum physicists in the 1920s.\n\n== Physics and public relations ==\nThe DPG plays an active role in the dialogue between science and the general public with a range of popular scientific publications, physics outreach, and public events. These activities also include the Highlights of Physics, an annual physics festival organised jointly by the DPG and the Federal Ministry of Education and Research. It is the largest festival of its kind in Germany with around 30,000 visitors every year.\n\n== Studies and social commitment ==\nThe DPG engages in socio-political discussions by releasing press statements, carrying out studies, giving statements and attending parliamentary evenings. It deals with current issues such as fostering young talent, climate protection, energy supply or arms control through to science and cultural history issues. The DPG is very particularly committed to equal opportunities for men and women and to promote women in natural sciences.\n\n== In Bonn and Berlin ==\nThe DPG office headed by the Chief Executive Bernhard Nunner is located in the Physikzentrum Bad Honnef (physics conference centre in Bad Honnef), in the neighbourhood of the university and federal city of Bonn. The Physikzentrum is not only a meeting place and discussion forum of outstanding significance for physics in Germany but also an international brand for the discipline of physics. Students and cutting edge scientists through to Nobel Prize winners meet here to share their thoughts and ideas on a scientific level. Teaching staffs also gladly come to Bad Honnef time and again to attend advanced training courses relating to pure physics and the didactic aspects of this discipline, in the seminars held by the DPG. The DPG is also present in Germany's capital Berlin. It has been running the Magnus-Haus in Berlin since its reunification with the Physical Society of East Germany in 1990. This urban palace completed in 1760 – bearing the name of the natural scientist Gustav Magnus – has close links to the history of the DPG: it was the regular meeting place of scholars during the 19th century that eventually resulted in the Physical Society of Berlin being founded in 1845, which later became the DPG. Today it is a venue for meetings and lectures on physical and socio-political issues. The Magnus-Haus is also home to the DPG's historical archive.\n\n== Under National Socialism ==\nThe DPG was in opposition to National Socialism's persecution of the Jews in general, and their promotion of Deutsche Physik, in particular. On 7 April 1933, barely two months after Adolf Hitler came to power on 30 January 1933, the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, was passed; under this law, Jewish civil servants and regime opponents were removed from their jobs. These policies had significant effects on physics in Germany through significant qualitative and quantitative losses of physicists as a result of emigration and through political decisions overriding those based on academic and scientific considerations; 25% of the physicists holding academic positions in the period 1932–1933 were lost due to the policies. The opposition can be illustrated by just a few examples, such as the DPG not immediately dismissing Jews after passage of the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, Max von Laue's address at the opening of the 1933 physics convention in Würzburg, opposition to Johannes Stark exercising the Führerprinzip in attempting to become the dictator of physics, and Carl Ramsauer's opposition to the politicization of education:\n\n== Reunification ==\nAfter the conclusion of World War II, in 1946, von Laue initiated the founding of the Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft in only the British Zone, as the Allied Control Council would not initially allow organizations across occupation zone boundaries. The DPG was eventually also reinstituted individually in the American and French sectors. These individually established organizations were united in West Germany in 1950, only after the formation of the Federal Republic of Germany on 23 May 1949. It was only after the fall of the Berlin Wall that the DPG again fully unified across Germany.", "src": "== Conferences and fostering young talent ==\nThe DPG itself does not carry out any research, but its conferences promote the sharing of information about the latest findings in the field of physics.

And the web portal www.welt-der-physik.de, operated jointly by the DPG and the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF), provides much information about physics even for nonexperts.\n\n== Historical publications ==\nPublications of the DPG have included:\n\nFrom the time of its creation in 1845, the DPG published Fortschritte der Physik and its Verhandlungen, but by 1919, the Verhandlungen had become too voluminous, so DPG chairman Arnold Sommerfeld formed a committee consisting of Albert Einstein, Eugen Goldstein, Fritz Haber, E. Jahnke, Karl Scheel, and Wilhelm Westphal, which recommended that a new journal, the Zeitschrift für Physik, should be established for rapid publication of original research articles by established scientists without peer review; it began publication the following year. In 1975 Zeitschrift für Physik was merged with Physics of Condensed Matter (ISSN 0340-2347). Zeitschrift für Physik was published as a 4-part journal from 1920–1997 by Springer-Verlag under the auspices of the DPG. During the early 20th century, it was considered one of the most prestigious journals in physics, with its golden years coinciding with the golden years of quantum mechanics. It was the vehicle used by those with avant-garde views and the young generation of quantum physicists in the 1920s.\n\n== Physics and public relations ==\nThe DPG plays an active role in the dialogue between science and the general public with a range of popular scientific publications, physics outreach, and public events. These activities also include the Highlights of Physics, an annual physics festival organised jointly by the DPG and the Federal Ministry of Education and Research. It is the largest festival of its kind in Germany with around 30,000 visitors every year.\n\n== Studies and social commitment ==\nThe DPG engages in socio-political discussions by releasing press statements, carrying out studies, giving statements and attending parliamentary evenings. It deals with current issues such as fostering young talent, climate protection, energy supply or arms control through to science and cultural history issues. The DPG is very particularly committed to equal opportunities for men and women and to promote women in natural sciences.\n\n== In Bonn and Berlin ==\nThe DPG office headed by the Chief Executive Bernhard Nunner is located in the Physikzentrum Bad Honnef (physics conference centre in Bad Honnef), in the neighbourhood of the university and federal city of Bonn. The Physikzentrum is not only a meeting place and discussion forum of outstanding significance for physics in Germany but also an international brand for the discipline of physics. Students and cutting edge scientists through to Nobel Prize winners meet here to share their thoughts and ideas on a scientific level. Teaching staffs also gladly come to Bad Honnef time and again to attend advanced training courses relating to pure physics and the didactic aspects of this discipline, in the seminars held by the DPG. The DPG is also present in Germany's capital Berlin. It has been running the Magnus-Haus in Berlin since its reunification with the Physical Society of East Germany in 1990. This urban palace completed in 1760 – bearing the name of the natural scientist Gustav Magnus – has close links to the history of the DPG: it was the regular meeting place of scholars during the 19th century that eventually resulted in the Physical Society of Berlin being founded in 1845, which later became the DPG. Today it is a venue for meetings and lectures on physical and socio-political issues. The Magnus-Haus is also home to the DPG's historical archive.\n\n== Under National Socialism ==\nThe DPG was in opposition to National Socialism's persecution of the Jews in general, and their promotion of Deutsche Physik, in particular. On 7 April 1933, barely two months after Adolf Hitler came to power on 30 January 1933, the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, was passed; under this law, Jewish civil servants and regime opponents were removed from their jobs. These policies had significant effects on physics in Germany through significant qualitative and quantitative losses of physicists as a result of emigration and through political decisions overriding those based on academic and scientific considerations; 25% of the physicists holding academic positions in the period 1932–1933 were lost due to the policies. The opposition can be illustrated by just a few examples, such as the DPG not immediately dismissing Jews after passage of the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, Max von Laue's address at the opening of the 1933 physics convention in Würzburg, opposition to Johannes Stark exercising the Führerprinzip in attempting to become the dictator of physics, and Carl Ramsauer's opposition to the politicization of education:\n\n== Reunification ==\nAfter the conclusion of World War II, in 1946, von Laue initiated the founding of the Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft in only the British Zone, as the Allied Control Council would not initially allow organizations across occupation zone boundaries. The DPG was eventually also reinstituted individually in the American and French sectors. These individually established organizations were united in West Germany in 1950, only after the formation of the Federal Republic of Germany on 23 May 1949. It was only after the fall of the Berlin Wall that the DPG again fully unified across Germany.", "page_title": "German Physical Society", "word_tertile": "high", "trgt": "The German Physical Society (German: Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft, DPG) is the oldest organisation of physicists. The DPG's worldwide membership is cited as 60,547, as of 2019, making it the largest physics society in the world. It holds an annual conference (Jahrestagung) and multiple spring conferences (Frühjahrstagungen), which are held at various locations and along topical subjects of given sections of the DPG. The DPG serves the fields of pure and applied physics. Main aims are to bring its members and all physicists living in Germany closer together, represent their entirety outwards as well as foster the exchange of ideas between its members and foreign colleagues. The DPG binds itself and its members to advocate for freedom, tolerance, veracity and dignity in science and to be aware about the fact that the people working in science are responsible to a particularly high extent for the configuration of the overall human activity.", "mgt_few3": "The German Physical Society (DPG) is a scientific organization founded in 1845 with a membership of over 60,000.

The traditional spring meetings held by the DPG each year at venues across the country are among largest physics conferences in Europe, attended by around 10,000 experts from Germany and abroad. Fostering young talent is another central concern of the DPG: its conferences provide a platform particularly for younger scientists. The conferences provide students with opportunities to meet renowned scientists in person. The DPG also runs a nationwide network for physics students in the working group Young DPG. Female physicists have a forum of their own in the annual German Conference of Women in Physics.\n\n== Awards and school projects ==\nThe DPG honours outstanding achievements in physics with awards of international repute. The highest awards which are presented by the DPG are the Max Planck Medal for work in theoretical physics, first awarded in 1929, and the Stern–Gerlach Medal for work in experimental physics, first awarded in 1933. Some awards, such as the Gustav Hertz Prize for Young Physicists, intend to foster young talent. Others are awarded by the DPG in cooperation with other organisations in Germany and abroad, such as the Max Born Medal and Prize or the Otto Hahn Prize. The Medal for Natural Science Journalism is awarded by the DPG to personalities who have made a special contribution to bringing scientific facts to the attention of the general public. In addition, the DPG awards prizes to school graduates throughout the country for outstanding achievements in physics. It supports competitions for school students such as the Jugend forscht (national research contest for young scientists), promotes innovative school projects and organises advanced training courses for teaching staff.\n\n== Young Scientist Award for Socio- and Econophysics ==\nSince 2002, the Fachverband Physik sozio-ökonomischer Systeme (Physics of Socio-Economic Systems Division) recognizes \"outstanding original contributions that use physical methods to develop a better understanding of socio-economic problems\". Awardees are Vittoria Colizza (2013), Arne Traulsen (2012), Santo Fortunato (2011), Dirk Brockmann (2010), Duncan Watts (2009), Fabrizio Lillo (2008), Katarzyna Sznajd-Weron (2007) for the Sznajd model, Xavier Gabaix (2006), Reuven Cohen (2005), Illes Farkas (2004), Vasliki Plerou (2002) and Damien Challet (2002).\n\n== Publications ==\nThe DPG produces a range of various publications. The membership journal of the DPG Physik Journal provides news reports from the DPG and about physics in general. Besides, the DPG joins forces with the British Institute of Physics to publish the electronic open access journal New Journal of Physics. The articles published here have gone through a strict peer review in line with the stringent scientific quality standards propounded by the New Journal of Physics.

The result was When You Wish, a new revue that, though intended to ultimately to play on Broadway, failed to make it past the workshop stage, despite having Tony Award-winning actress Faith Prince attached to the project.\n\nInstead, Walt Disney Theatrical president Thomas Schumacher, along with director and choreographer Robert Longbottom, conceived a new show meant specifically for the road: On the Record, which would tell a very simple story of four recording artists in a studio. Though the developers of the production originally planned to create more complex characters and greater tension between them in the studio, they instead eventually \"watered down\" the plot for more general revue entertainment, because, says Longbottom, the \"songs were from so many different character points of views, [that one] couldn't begin to create a book musical that would allow them to coexist.\"\n\nAfter the basic concept of the show had been developed, musical arranger and supervisor David Chase joined the project. Collaborating with Longbottom, Chase delved through Disney's music canon to extract songs that would showcase the personality of the characters and would be able to tell the story without spoken words. Designers Robert Brill, Gregg Barnes, and Natasha Katz took on the task of creating a classy show with modest design elements, so the production would be able to travel easily.\n\nAfter technical elements of the show began to come together, casting auditions were held in June 2004 around the country, including New York City and Cleveland. Broadway veterans Emily Skinner and Brian Sutherland were cast as the older, more experienced couple of recording artists, while newcomers Ashley Brown and Andrew Samonsky were cast in the roles of the newer musicians. Richard Easton received the role of the Sound Engineer, a part that was ultimately cut from the show. Kaitlin Hopkins, as the only actor to regularly replace one of the original four leads, took over Skinner's role as Diane on January 15, 2005. In its 36-week tour, On the Record was performed for over 350,000 people, opening on November 19, 2004 at Cleveland, Ohio's Palace Theater and closing July 31, 2005 at Denver, Colorado's Denver Center for the Performing Arts. While the production was originally planned to run through September 4, after playing to disappointing, small audiences, the production ultimately decided on an earlier closing date after only two months on the road. There are currently no plans for either Equity or non-Equity licensing of the production.\n\nIn April 2009, the show saw new life in the form of Children's Musical Theatre of San Jose's production of When You Wish, a separate revue based on On the Record. Adapted by the theater's artistic director, Kevin Hauge, When You Wish, much unlike its basis, tells the story of three children who stumble upon a fantasy world in which they meet many beloved Disney characters. While When You Wish abandons the recording studio setting, it incorporates On the Record's same catalog of 71 years of Disney music. Later in 2014 White Plains Performing Arts Center presented the regional premiere of the production in its original form with a few new additions to the production.\n\n== Synopsis ==\nOn the Record, like most revues, involves characters that express their personalities and emotions with the use of song, rather than speech. In this case, the characters tell the show's simple, almost non-existent plot through selections of Disney music. The story is one of a love rectangle between four recording artists, including reigning pop diva Diane, matinee idol Julian, and the fresh faces on the music scene Kristen and Nick, recording a Disney compilation album. Upon entering the studio, Kristen instantly develops a crush on teen heartthrob-to-be, Nick, though Nick initially denies any attraction. Meanwhile, Julian attempts to rekindle an apparent ex-relationship with Diane but is often interrupted by his unrequited love's flirtation with the younger talent. As the show comes to an end, though, Diane comes back to Julian, remembering how precious their time together had once been. Nick, in turn, learns to embrace love and professes that he will always be there for Kristen.\n\n== Music ==\nMusical numbers in On the Record are performed by the previously mentioned four principal characters, as well as a separate, unnamed quartet, and an eight-member orchestra. While the show is often advertised as a collection of 64 Disney songs, there are actually 71, with three of them reprised. Hardly any song, however, is performed in its entirety. Under the musical adaptation and arrangement by David Chase, songs also take different twists on their original counterparts from film or stage. \"Be Our Guest\" especially drifts from the original film version in that it is sung in a surplus of different languages. Julian sings a portion of the song in French, Diane sings in German, Kristen sings in Japanese, Nick sings in Swedish, and the company sings other portions in English and other languages. \"The Work Song\", however, hardly drifts from the original version at all, digitally altering the characters' voices to imitate those of Cinderella's mice.\n\nThe 75 years of Disney music represented in the revue dates back to \"Minnie's Yoo-Hoo\" from a 1929 Mickey Mouse short called Mickey's Follies, with the recent selection being \"Will the Sun Ever Shine Again\" from the 2004 film Home on the Range. On the Record includes a total of eight Academy Award for Best Song winners: \"When You Wish Upon a Star\" from Pinocchio, \"Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah\" from Song of the South, \"Under the Sea\" from The Little Mermaid, \"Beauty and the Beast\" from Beauty and the Beast, \"A Whole New World\" from Aladdin, \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\" from The Lion King, \"Colors of the Wind\" from Pocahontas, and \"You'll Be in My Heart\" from Tarzan. The catalogue of music does not only come from the screen, however, but also from such Disneyland attractions as It's a Small World and The Enchanted Tiki Room, both with songs by Disney's prolific songwriter brother duo, Richard and Robert Sherman. Also performed in the musical is composer Alan Menken's \"A Change in Me\" — a song written for Toni Braxton when she entered the role of Belle in the Broadway production of Beauty and the Beast.\n\nThe songs are grouped into 15 recording sessions, as well as a prologue, finale, and a collection of instrumentals played after curtain call as the audience exits the theater, with each section's songs holding a unifying theme. Some sessions contain themes such as falling in love, while others may contain songs made up of entirely nonsense words, or even numbers about foreign cuisine. More often than not, songs within a session are presented in the form of a medley, leading directly into one another, without a break between them.\n\nReleased to stores on March 15, 2005, the cast recording, featuring the entire original cast, excluding Emily Skinner and including Kaitlin Hopkins, received decent reviews. Produced by Walt Disney Records, the two-disc set with a total of 45 tracks was mostly acclaimed for the talent of the cast and the timelessness of the Disney favorites. Because the show contains very little dialogue, the two discs are a recording of very nearly the entire show. Further, in a meta-twist, because the show's plot involves the characters recording an album of Disney's greatest hits, the cast album effectively is the very compilation that the characters are working to create.\n\n== Credits ==\nMany composers and lyricists are credited as working on this project, inasmuch as their songs are included in the show:\n\n\n\n== Response ==\nDuring its nine-month run, On the Record received mixed reviews. Regional theatre reviewer Ann Miner commented in her review of the production that the gimmicks giving new twists to the classic songs, including monkey imitations in The Jungle Book's \"I Wanna Be Like You\" and glow-in-the-dark microphone cords in The Little Mermaid's \"Poor Unfortunate Souls\", translated poorly to stage. Pittsburgh Post-Gazette writer Christopher Rawson felt as though the attempt to create a storyline was too forced and that the show should have taken a general revue route by completely scrapping the plot. While Rawson described the production as \"unimpressive\", he, among others, felt that the eight-member cast was talented.\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe revue proved to be the beginning of Ashley Brown's relationship with Disney's theatrical department. After receiving positive reviews for her performance as Kristen, Brown landed the role of Belle in Beauty and the Beast on Broadway on September 20, 2005. After completing her run as Belle on May 28, 2006, Brown opened the Broadway production of Mary Poppins on November 16, 2006, in the title role — a performance which earned her a Drama Desk Award nomination for Outstanding Actress in a Musical. Brown ended her Broadway run on October 5, 2008, but subsequently returned to the role, opening the North American national tour of Mary Poppins in Chicago on March 25, 2009. Meredith Inglesby, who served as a member of the quartet and as Diane's understudy, also found success with Disney Theatrical Productions, landing the roles of Babette the feather duster in the same production of Beauty and the Beast and later, Carlotta in the Broadway production of The Little Mermaid. She can be seen as Hannah in the North American tour of Newsies. Also, Tyler Maynard of the quartet has gone on to work with Walt Disney Theatrical, both in Mary Poppins as Valentine and, subsequently, in The Little Mermaid as Flotsam.", "src": "== Production development history ==\nFollowing the successful stage productions of Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, and Aida, Walt Disney Theatrical began to brainstorm a way to showcase Disney's wide catalogue of songs without the use of a movie screen to present them.

The show tells a simple story of four recording artists in a studio setting, using Disney songs to convey emotions and personalities. Despite mixed reviews during its run, the production featured a talented cast and led to future successes for some of its performers, including Ashley Brown, who went on to star in Broadway productions like \"Beauty and the Beast\" and \"Mary Poppins.\"", "prompt": "Your task is to summarize an article to create a Wikipedia lead section. \n- In Wikipedia, the lead section is an introduction to an article and a summary of its most important contents. \n- Apart from basic facts, significant information should not appear in the lead if it is not covered in the remainder of the article.\n\nGenerate the lead for the article titled \"On the Record (musical)\" using the article's body above with no more than 99 words.

The result was When You Wish, a new revue that, though intended to ultimately to play on Broadway, failed to make it past the workshop stage, despite having Tony Award-winning actress Faith Prince attached to the project.\n\nInstead, Walt Disney Theatrical president Thomas Schumacher, along with director and choreographer Robert Longbottom, conceived a new show meant specifically for the road: On the Record, which would tell a very simple story of four recording artists in a studio. Though the developers of the production originally planned to create more complex characters and greater tension between them in the studio, they instead eventually \"watered down\" the plot for more general revue entertainment, because, says Longbottom, the \"songs were from so many different character points of views, [that one] couldn't begin to create a book musical that would allow them to coexist.\"\n\nAfter the basic concept of the show had been developed, musical arranger and supervisor David Chase joined the project. Collaborating with Longbottom, Chase delved through Disney's music canon to extract songs that would showcase the personality of the characters and would be able to tell the story without spoken words. Designers Robert Brill, Gregg Barnes, and Natasha Katz took on the task of creating a classy show with modest design elements, so the production would be able to travel easily.\n\nAfter technical elements of the show began to come together, casting auditions were held in June 2004 around the country, including New York City and Cleveland. Broadway veterans Emily Skinner and Brian Sutherland were cast as the older, more experienced couple of recording artists, while newcomers Ashley Brown and Andrew Samonsky were cast in the roles of the newer musicians. Richard Easton received the role of the Sound Engineer, a part that was ultimately cut from the show. Kaitlin Hopkins, as the only actor to regularly replace one of the original four leads, took over Skinner's role as Diane on January 15, 2005. In its 36-week tour, On the Record was performed for over 350,000 people, opening on November 19, 2004 at Cleveland, Ohio's Palace Theater and closing July 31, 2005 at Denver, Colorado's Denver Center for the Performing Arts. While the production was originally planned to run through September 4, after playing to disappointing, small audiences, the production ultimately decided on an earlier closing date after only two months on the road. There are currently no plans for either Equity or non-Equity licensing of the production.\n\nIn April 2009, the show saw new life in the form of Children's Musical Theatre of San Jose's production of When You Wish, a separate revue based on On the Record. Adapted by the theater's artistic director, Kevin Hauge, When You Wish, much unlike its basis, tells the story of three children who stumble upon a fantasy world in which they meet many beloved Disney characters. While When You Wish abandons the recording studio setting, it incorporates On the Record's same catalog of 71 years of Disney music. Later in 2014 White Plains Performing Arts Center presented the regional premiere of the production in its original form with a few new additions to the production.\n\n== Synopsis ==\nOn the Record, like most revues, involves characters that express their personalities and emotions with the use of song, rather than speech. In this case, the characters tell the show's simple, almost non-existent plot through selections of Disney music. The story is one of a love rectangle between four recording artists, including reigning pop diva Diane, matinee idol Julian, and the fresh faces on the music scene Kristen and Nick, recording a Disney compilation album. Upon entering the studio, Kristen instantly develops a crush on teen heartthrob-to-be, Nick, though Nick initially denies any attraction. Meanwhile, Julian attempts to rekindle an apparent ex-relationship with Diane but is often interrupted by his unrequited love's flirtation with the younger talent. As the show comes to an end, though, Diane comes back to Julian, remembering how precious their time together had once been. Nick, in turn, learns to embrace love and professes that he will always be there for Kristen.\n\n== Music ==\nMusical numbers in On the Record are performed by the previously mentioned four principal characters, as well as a separate, unnamed quartet, and an eight-member orchestra. While the show is often advertised as a collection of 64 Disney songs, there are actually 71, with three of them reprised. Hardly any song, however, is performed in its entirety. Under the musical adaptation and arrangement by David Chase, songs also take different twists on their original counterparts from film or stage. \"Be Our Guest\" especially drifts from the original film version in that it is sung in a surplus of different languages. Julian sings a portion of the song in French, Diane sings in German, Kristen sings in Japanese, Nick sings in Swedish, and the company sings other portions in English and other languages. \"The Work Song\", however, hardly drifts from the original version at all, digitally altering the characters' voices to imitate those of Cinderella's mice.\n\nThe 75 years of Disney music represented in the revue dates back to \"Minnie's Yoo-Hoo\" from a 1929 Mickey Mouse short called Mickey's Follies, with the recent selection being \"Will the Sun Ever Shine Again\" from the 2004 film Home on the Range. On the Record includes a total of eight Academy Award for Best Song winners: \"When You Wish Upon a Star\" from Pinocchio, \"Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah\" from Song of the South, \"Under the Sea\" from The Little Mermaid, \"Beauty and the Beast\" from Beauty and the Beast, \"A Whole New World\" from Aladdin, \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\" from The Lion King, \"Colors of the Wind\" from Pocahontas, and \"You'll Be in My Heart\" from Tarzan. The catalogue of music does not only come from the screen, however, but also from such Disneyland attractions as It's a Small World and The Enchanted Tiki Room, both with songs by Disney's prolific songwriter brother duo, Richard and Robert Sherman. Also performed in the musical is composer Alan Menken's \"A Change in Me\" — a song written for Toni Braxton when she entered the role of Belle in the Broadway production of Beauty and the Beast.\n\nThe songs are grouped into 15 recording sessions, as well as a prologue, finale, and a collection of instrumentals played after curtain call as the audience exits the theater, with each section's songs holding a unifying theme. Some sessions contain themes such as falling in love, while others may contain songs made up of entirely nonsense words, or even numbers about foreign cuisine. More often than not, songs within a session are presented in the form of a medley, leading directly into one another, without a break between them.\n\nReleased to stores on March 15, 2005, the cast recording, featuring the entire original cast, excluding Emily Skinner and including Kaitlin Hopkins, received decent reviews. Produced by Walt Disney Records, the two-disc set with a total of 45 tracks was mostly acclaimed for the talent of the cast and the timelessness of the Disney favorites. Because the show contains very little dialogue, the two discs are a recording of very nearly the entire show. Further, in a meta-twist, because the show's plot involves the characters recording an album of Disney's greatest hits, the cast album effectively is the very compilation that the characters are working to create.\n\n== Credits ==\nMany composers and lyricists are credited as working on this project, inasmuch as their songs are included in the show:\n\n\n\n== Response ==\nDuring its nine-month run, On the Record received mixed reviews. Regional theatre reviewer Ann Miner commented in her review of the production that the gimmicks giving new twists to the classic songs, including monkey imitations in The Jungle Book's \"I Wanna Be Like You\" and glow-in-the-dark microphone cords in The Little Mermaid's \"Poor Unfortunate Souls\", translated poorly to stage. Pittsburgh Post-Gazette writer Christopher Rawson felt as though the attempt to create a storyline was too forced and that the show should have taken a general revue route by completely scrapping the plot. While Rawson described the production as \"unimpressive\", he, among others, felt that the eight-member cast was talented.\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe revue proved to be the beginning of Ashley Brown's relationship with Disney's theatrical department. After receiving positive reviews for her performance as Kristen, Brown landed the role of Belle in Beauty and the Beast on Broadway on September 20, 2005. After completing her run as Belle on May 28, 2006, Brown opened the Broadway production of Mary Poppins on November 16, 2006, in the title role — a performance which earned her a Drama Desk Award nomination for Outstanding Actress in a Musical. Brown ended her Broadway run on October 5, 2008, but subsequently returned to the role, opening the North American national tour of Mary Poppins in Chicago on March 25, 2009. Meredith Inglesby, who served as a member of the quartet and as Diane's understudy, also found success with Disney Theatrical Productions, landing the roles of Babette the feather duster in the same production of Beauty and the Beast and later, Carlotta in the Broadway production of The Little Mermaid. She can be seen as Hannah in the North American tour of Newsies. Also, Tyler Maynard of the quartet has gone on to work with Walt Disney Theatrical, both in Mary Poppins as Valentine and, subsequently, in The Little Mermaid as Flotsam.\"\"\""}

The first bombardier training class (42-17) at San Angelo Army Airfield began in September 1942, and San Angelo's 34th Flying Training Wing (Bombardier and Specialized Twin- and Four-Engine) activated on 8 January 1943, as one of two dedicated bombardier training wings. The other was WCACTC's 38th Flying Training Wing at Williams Army Airfield, Arizona—later moved to Kirtland Field, New Mexico).\n\nThe GCACTC's Advanced Twin Engine and Bombardier Training Center at Midland Army Airfield was redesignated an Army Air Forces Bombardier School on 26 September 1942 (Colonel Ryan was the Director of Training Jan 1942 – Aug 1943). The Midland school operated 23 bombing ranges in West Texas, and the Central Bombardier Instructor School was moved to Midland in August 1943 from Carlsbad Army Airfield. The WCACTC's Kirtland Field bombardier school that operated ranges west of Albuquerque was depicted in the 1943 Bombardier film. The first graduates with dual ratings as Navigator/Bombardier were in April 1944.\n\nIn addition to visual bomb scoring and sound ranging for determining scores for bombardiers, Radar Bomb Scoring (RBS) began during World War II. On 6 June 1945, \"the 206th Army Air Force Base Unit (RBS) (206th AAFBU), was activated at Colorado Springs, Colorado for [RBS with] operational control of the two SCR-584 radar detachments located at Kansas City and Fort Worth\" Army Airfield.

{"id": 23264, "revid": "1097429245", "src_inf": "== Early life ==\nSarason was born in Brownsville, Brooklyn New York on January 12, 1919. Both of his parents, Maxwell and Anna (Silverlight) Sarason, were Jewish immigrants and his father worked in a children's clothes factory in the garment district of Manhattan. Sarason grew up with his sister, Mildred, and his brother, Irwin (who also became a psychologist). At the age of six his family moved to Newark, New Jersey. Sarason was a teenager during the Great Depression and he sold frozen treats and handkerchiefs to help support his family.\n\nDuring his junior year in high school, Sarason was diagnosed with polio and he lost mobility in his right arm. After a successful surgery that was financed by the New Jersey State Rehabilitation Commission, he regained some functionality of his right arm. Due to the physical limitations Sarason experienced as a result of polio, he became more interested in writing as a career (one of the activities he could still do with his right arm). He was especially interested in becoming a playwright, and he credited his interest in creative writing as one factor that drew him to psychology.\n\n== Education ==\nSarason attended public schools throughout his childhood. When he was seven years old, he began attending Temple B’Nai Abraham, a Hebrew school in New Jersey, on some afternoons and Sunday mornings. As a result of his polio diagnosis, the New Jersey State Rehabilitation Commission collaborated with Dana College (which was later incorporated into Rutgers University) to provide Sarason with a scholarship loan to attend college. He received a bachelor's degree from Dana College in 1939. He obtained a Master's of Arts (1940) and a Ph.D. (1942) in Clinical Psychology from Clark University. At Clark University his research mentor was Saul Rosenzweig and Sarason was the first student at Clark to obtain practical experience working as an extern at a hospital.\n\n== Southbury Training School ==\nAfter obtaining a Ph.D. from Clark University in 1942, Sarason served for three years as the chief psychologist at the Southbury Training School, a residential facility for children and adults with intellectual disabilities. Sarason noted that the goal of the Southbury Training School was to train and educate residents, and then help them return to their homes and communities. While at the Southbury Training School, Sarason administered many psychological evaluations and conducted psychotherapy. He developed a humanistic view of people with intellectual disabilities after witnessing their creativity and their rich emotional experiences. Based on his work at the Southbury Training School, he published articles on the use of projective psychological tests with people with intellectual disabilities, the use of creativity in therapy, and conducting psychotherapy with people with intellectual disabilities.\n\nWhile at the Southbury Training School, Sarason became frustrated with individual-based psychological theories that did not consider social context. He also became frustrated by the organization's growing insensitivity toward the well-being of its residents. Sarason stated that the Southbury Training School developed a bureaucratic structure, began to experience departmental rivalries, and lacked effective leadership. He began to wonder why the Southbury Training School deteriorated and whether he could create a setting that effectively and sustainably pursued its purpose.\n\n== Yale University ==\nIn 1945, Carl Hovland, the chair of the Department of Psychology at Yale, offered Sarason an Assistant Clinical Professor Position. In addition to teaching clinical courses and supervising clinical students in psychological testing and report writing, Sarason also published papers on projective techniques during his first few years at Yale. Although Sarason is not well known for his work on projective techniques, he appreciated this work because it gave him insight into how human problem solving adapts based on the specific task at hand.\n\n== Intellectual disability ==\nBased largely on his experiences at the Southbury Training School, Sarason published his first book in 1949: Psychological Problems in Mental Deficiency. This book provided a new approach to intellectual disabilities that emphasized social and cultural factors that affect our understanding of intellectual disability. This book became popular in schools of education, and Sarason became well known in the field of education and, more specifically, special education.\n\n== Teacher preparation and school reform ==\nIn the 1950s, Sarason developed a close friendship and working relationship with Burton Blatt, the chair of the department of special education at New Haven State College. Burton Blatt was interested in working with Sarason because of Sarason's influential research on intellectual disabilities in the field of education. Both Sarason and Blatt were interested in the preparation of teachers, and they believed that teachers lacked training in how to make educational decisions based on observations of student behavior. To highlight this concern, Sarason, Blatt, and another researcher (Ken Davidson) wrote The Preparation of Teachers: An Unstudied Problem in Education. This book emphasized the importance of taking a historical and sociological perspective when considering school reforms, such as considering the history of teacher training programs and how that history may impact teachers’ current work.\n\nIn 1965, Sarason predicted that all attempts to reform schools would fail. His prediction still has an accuracy of 100%. He believed that schooling needed fundamental changes. Further, he often stated that it was inconceivable to think that an ingrained human social system such as public schooling was easily reformed. The preparation and training of teachers was a good place to begin reform, according to Sarason.\n\n== Test anxiety and situational factors affecting test performance ==\nSarason's research interests in children's test anxiety developed from his observations that the performance of people with and without intellectual disabilities on intelligence tests could be impacted by anxiety related to the testing environment. For approximately 15 years, Sarason examined how test-taking attitudes and anxiety affect test performance. Summarizing some of his research, Sarason wrote The Clinical Interaction to describe situational factors in testing environments that can lead to inaccurate and confusing test results. Although Sarason's research was considered successful, he described his work as a “research factory” and he was frustrated by the lack of socially-relevant action based on his research (e.g., he was frustrated that his research did not lead to programs to help children who experienced high test anxiety).\n\n== Yale Psycho-Educational Clinic ==\nSarason was frustrated by the lack of social action in his research career, and he seized the opportunity to start a new clinic at Yale University so that he could be more involved in making positive social change. In the late 1950s Sarason was the supervisor of two clinical psychology interns who worked at the Yale Child Study Center, a child psychiatry organization. Because there was a lack of clients available for his supervisees at the Yale Child Study Center, Sarason decided to start a psychology clinic within the Yale Department of Psychology after gaining approval from the chair of the department, Claude Buxton. In the early 1960s Sarason founded the Yale Psycho-Educational Clinic. Although some clients did visit the clinic for psychotherapy and clinical assessments, the clinic was unique in that most of the clinic staff spent the majority of their time in community settings working directly with community organizations. The clinic aimed to expand the role of clinical psychologists to include working in community settings and helping to solve community-based problems. Through his work in the clinic, Sarason also sought to better understand the creation and sustainability of settings. He defined settings as “any instance in which two or more people come together in new relationships over a sustained period of time in order to achieve certain goals.”\n\nThe history of the Yale Psycho-Educational Clinic can be separated into two time periods. During the first time period from 1963 to 1965, Sarason and his colleagues aimed to gain entrance into various settings by partnering with organizations, including public schools, anti-poverty programs, and a center for intellectually disabled people. During the second time period from 1965 to 1973, Sarason and the clinic staff focused on studying how settings were created and factors that influenced their longevity. Sarason's main method of investigation involved him acting as a participant-observer who collaborated with various organizations to help solve problems (e.g., low student academic performance, low recruitment for anti-poverty programs). Based on this work, Sarason argued that clinical psychologists should expand their individual-based focus and consider how broader settings contribute to both well-being and pathology. He also argued that changing and reforming settings requires a deep understanding of those settings. Finally, Sarason identified several issues that are relevant to the creation and sustainability of settings, such as having positive external relationships with other people and organizations, having strong leadership at the organizational level, and maintaining realistic expectations about the organization's needs and influence. Sararson's and his colleagues’ work at the clinic resulted in seven books and many articles.\n\n== Publications ==\nSeymour Sarason is considered the “father” and “conscience” of Community Psychology because he advocated for the development of a psychology that focused on contextual factors that impact human behavior, the prevention of pathology instead of treatment, and being a collaborative partner rather than an expert. Many of the ideas important to the field of Community Psychology originated from Sarason's work with the Yale Psycho-Educational Clinic. Sarason's influential publications in the field of Community Psychology include:\n\nSarason was world-renowned as an expert in school reform. Some of his notable publications on education and school reform include:\n\nSarason's notable publications on intellectual disability include:\n\nSarason served as president of the Division of Clinical Psychology of the American Psychological Association from 1978-1979. A selection of Sarason's notable publications within the field of clinical psychology, including test anxiety research, include:\n\nSarason also wrote about career expectations, published an autobiography, and wrote a novel:\n\n== Honors and awards ==\nSarason received many awards from multiple organizations. These awards include:\n\nSarason received three honorary degrees:\n\nTo honor Sarason's legacy, in 1993 the Society for Community Research and Action, Division 27 of the American Psychological Association, established the Seymour B. Sarason Award for Community Research and Action.\n\n== Personal life ==\nWhile working toward his Ph.D. at Clark University, Sarason met Esther Kroop, a fellow graduate student. Sarason married Esther Kroop in 1943, and they had one daughter, Julie. After 50 years of marriage, Esther died in a car accident in 1993. Later in his life, Sarason's companion was Dr. Irma Janoff Miller. Sarason was described as an incredibly warm and welcoming man who made a positive impact on the lives of many students, colleagues, and scholars. Sarason died on January 28, 2010 in New Haven, Connecticut at the age of 91.", "src": "== Early life ==\nSarason was born in Brownsville, Brooklyn New York on January 12, 1919.

Although Sarason is not well known for his work on projective techniques, he appreciated this work because it gave him insight into how human problem solving adapts based on the specific task at hand.\n\n== Intellectual disability ==\nBased largely on his experiences at the Southbury Training School, Sarason published his first book in 1949: Psychological Problems in Mental Deficiency. This book provided a new approach to intellectual disabilities that emphasized social and cultural factors that affect our understanding of intellectual disability. This book became popular in schools of education, and Sarason became well known in the field of education and, more specifically, special education.\n\n== Teacher preparation and school reform ==\nIn the 1950s, Sarason developed a close friendship and working relationship with Burton Blatt, the chair of the department of special education at New Haven State College. Burton Blatt was interested in working with Sarason because of Sarason's influential research on intellectual disabilities in the field of education. Both Sarason and Blatt were interested in the preparation of teachers, and they believed that teachers lacked training in how to make educational decisions based on observations of student behavior. To highlight this concern, Sarason, Blatt, and another researcher (Ken Davidson) wrote The Preparation of Teachers: An Unstudied Problem in Education. This book emphasized the importance of taking a historical and sociological perspective when considering school reforms, such as considering the history of teacher training programs and how that history may impact teachers’ current work.\n\nIn 1965, Sarason predicted that all attempts to reform schools would fail. His prediction still has an accuracy of 100%. He believed that schooling needed fundamental changes. Further, he often stated that it was inconceivable to think that an ingrained human social system such as public schooling was easily reformed. The preparation and training of teachers was a good place to begin reform, according to Sarason.\n\n== Test anxiety and situational factors affecting test performance ==\nSarason's research interests in children's test anxiety developed from his observations that the performance of people with and without intellectual disabilities on intelligence tests could be impacted by anxiety related to the testing environment. For approximately 15 years, Sarason examined how test-taking attitudes and anxiety affect test performance. Summarizing some of his research, Sarason wrote The Clinical Interaction to describe situational factors in testing environments that can lead to inaccurate and confusing test results. Although Sarason's research was considered successful, he described his work as a “research factory” and he was frustrated by the lack of socially-relevant action based on his research (e.g., he was frustrated that his research did not lead to programs to help children who experienced high test anxiety).\n\n== Yale Psycho-Educational Clinic ==\nSarason was frustrated by the lack of social action in his research career, and he seized the opportunity to start a new clinic at Yale University so that he could be more involved in making positive social change. In the late 1950s Sarason was the supervisor of two clinical psychology interns who worked at the Yale Child Study Center, a child psychiatry organization. Because there was a lack of clients available for his supervisees at the Yale Child Study Center, Sarason decided to start a psychology clinic within the Yale Department of Psychology after gaining approval from the chair of the department, Claude Buxton. In the early 1960s Sarason founded the Yale Psycho-Educational Clinic. Although some clients did visit the clinic for psychotherapy and clinical assessments, the clinic was unique in that most of the clinic staff spent the majority of their time in community settings working directly with community organizations. The clinic aimed to expand the role of clinical psychologists to include working in community settings and helping to solve community-based problems. Through his work in the clinic, Sarason also sought to better understand the creation and sustainability of settings. He defined settings as “any instance in which two or more people come together in new relationships over a sustained period of time in order to achieve certain goals.”\n\nThe history of the Yale Psycho-Educational Clinic can be separated into two time periods. During the first time period from 1963 to 1965, Sarason and his colleagues aimed to gain entrance into various settings by partnering with organizations, including public schools, anti-poverty programs, and a center for intellectually disabled people. During the second time period from 1965 to 1973, Sarason and the clinic staff focused on studying how settings were created and factors that influenced their longevity. Sarason's main method of investigation involved him acting as a participant-observer who collaborated with various organizations to help solve problems (e.g., low student academic performance, low recruitment for anti-poverty programs). Based on this work, Sarason argued that clinical psychologists should expand their individual-based focus and consider how broader settings contribute to both well-being and pathology. He also argued that changing and reforming settings requires a deep understanding of those settings. Finally, Sarason identified several issues that are relevant to the creation and sustainability of settings, such as having positive external relationships with other people and organizations, having strong leadership at the organizational level, and maintaining realistic expectations about the organization's needs and influence. Sararson's and his colleagues’ work at the clinic resulted in seven books and many articles.\n\n== Publications ==\nSeymour Sarason is considered the “father” and “conscience” of Community Psychology because he advocated for the development of a psychology that focused on contextual factors that impact human behavior, the prevention of pathology instead of treatment, and being a collaborative partner rather than an expert. Many of the ideas important to the field of Community Psychology originated from Sarason's work with the Yale Psycho-Educational Clinic. Sarason's influential publications in the field of Community Psychology include:\n\nSarason was world-renowned as an expert in school reform. Some of his notable publications on education and school reform include:\n\nSarason's notable publications on intellectual disability include:\n\nSarason served as president of the Division of Clinical Psychology of the American Psychological Association from 1978-1979. A selection of Sarason's notable publications within the field of clinical psychology, including test anxiety research, include:\n\nSarason also wrote about career expectations, published an autobiography, and wrote a novel:\n\n== Honors and awards ==\nSarason received many awards from multiple organizations. These awards include:\n\nSarason received three honorary degrees:\n\nTo honor Sarason's legacy, in 1993 the Society for Community Research and Action, Division 27 of the American Psychological Association, established the Seymour B. Sarason Award for Community Research and Action.\n\n== Personal life ==\nWhile working toward his Ph.D. at Clark University, Sarason met Esther Kroop, a fellow graduate student. Sarason married Esther Kroop in 1943, and they had one daughter, Julie. After 50 years of marriage, Esther died in a car accident in 1993. Later in his life, Sarason's companion was Dr. Irma Janoff Miller. Sarason was described as an incredibly warm and welcoming man who made a positive impact on the lives of many students, colleagues, and scholars.

He is the author of over forty books and over sixty articles, and he is considered to be one of the most significant American researchers in education, educational psychology, and community psychology. One primary focus of his work was on education reform in the United States. In the 1950s he and George Mandler initiated the research on test anxiety. He founded the Yale Psycho-Educational Clinic in 1961 and was one of the principal leaders in the community psychology movement.

Article:\n\n\"\"\"== Early life ==\nSarason was born in Brownsville, Brooklyn New York on January 12, 1919. Both of his parents, Maxwell and Anna (Silverlight) Sarason, were Jewish immigrants and his father worked in a children's clothes factory in the garment district of Manhattan. Sarason grew up with his sister, Mildred, and his brother, Irwin (who also became a psychologist). At the age of six his family moved to Newark, New Jersey. Sarason was a teenager during the Great Depression and he sold frozen treats and handkerchiefs to help support his family.\n\nDuring his junior year in high school, Sarason was diagnosed with polio and he lost mobility in his right arm. After a successful surgery that was financed by the New Jersey State Rehabilitation Commission, he regained some functionality of his right arm. Due to the physical limitations Sarason experienced as a result of polio, he became more interested in writing as a career (one of the activities he could still do with his right arm). He was especially interested in becoming a playwright, and he credited his interest in creative writing as one factor that drew him to psychology.\n\n== Education ==\nSarason attended public schools throughout his childhood. When he was seven years old, he began attending Temple B’Nai Abraham, a Hebrew school in New Jersey, on some afternoons and Sunday mornings. As a result of his polio diagnosis, the New Jersey State Rehabilitation Commission collaborated with Dana College (which was later incorporated into Rutgers University) to provide Sarason with a scholarship loan to attend college. He received a bachelor's degree from Dana College in 1939. He obtained a Master's of Arts (1940) and a Ph.D. (1942) in Clinical Psychology from Clark University. At Clark University his research mentor was Saul Rosenzweig and Sarason was the first student at Clark to obtain practical experience working as an extern at a hospital.\n\n== Southbury Training School ==\nAfter obtaining a Ph.D. from Clark University in 1942, Sarason served for three years as the chief psychologist at the Southbury Training School, a residential facility for children and adults with intellectual disabilities. Sarason noted that the goal of the Southbury Training School was to train and educate residents, and then help them return to their homes and communities. While at the Southbury Training School, Sarason administered many psychological evaluations and conducted psychotherapy. He developed a humanistic view of people with intellectual disabilities after witnessing their creativity and their rich emotional experiences. Based on his work at the Southbury Training School, he published articles on the use of projective psychological tests with people with intellectual disabilities, the use of creativity in therapy, and conducting psychotherapy with people with intellectual disabilities.\n\nWhile at the Southbury Training School, Sarason became frustrated with individual-based psychological theories that did not consider social context. He also became frustrated by the organization's growing insensitivity toward the well-being of its residents. Sarason stated that the Southbury Training School developed a bureaucratic structure, began to experience departmental rivalries, and lacked effective leadership. He began to wonder why the Southbury Training School deteriorated and whether he could create a setting that effectively and sustainably pursued its purpose.\n\n== Yale University ==\nIn 1945, Carl Hovland, the chair of the Department of Psychology at Yale, offered Sarason an Assistant Clinical Professor Position.

Oaks, then-president of BYU, wrote a letter to Ezra Taft Benson, then the President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church). The letter is quoted in Bergera's and Priddis's Brigham Young University: A House of Faith. In it, Oaks said that Nothing Very Important \"does not strengthen [Petsco's] efforts for employment at BYU\". Petsco's adjunct contract was not renewed in 1983. Petsco's health declined and he stopped writing fiction after this time.\n\n== Critical reception ==\nLavina Fielding Anderson described it as part of a movement in the 1960s and 1970s where Mormon authors writing literary fiction \"occupied an uncomfortable no-man's land.\" The collection of linked stories won the 1979 Association for Mormon Letters award for short fiction. The award citation stated that it marked a milestone in Mormon literature, as \"an important modern fictional work by and about a Latter-day Saint reared outside of the Wasatch-front cultural tradition.\" The stories were based on events from Petsco's life as a missionary in Southern California.\n\nReviews at the time acknowledged the book's limitations while praising its unique voice. Writing for the Association for Mormon Letters newsletter, Elouise Bell gave the book a favorable review. \"It is when the realism of the human animal encounters the idealism of the Mormon soul that the author's best stories result.\" She wrote that while Petsco's writing was \"smooth, professional, and highly readable\" that he had not yet mastered the genre of the self-contained short story. At Sunstone, Elizabeth Shaw wrote that the book did not explore moral dilemmas as thoroughly as other missionary fiction. However, Shaw wrote that \"the mood that emerges from Petsco's understated, almost off-hand prose allows me to face--without guilt--the cultural vagaries I assume by virtue of my membership in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. And that's a major accomplishment.\" She summarized the work as \"quick and clear and complex and renewing\". Michael Olsen at The Payson Chronicle wrote that the book was \"one of the most truthful but sometimes painfully objective pictures of Mormonism yet to come from the point of view of a true believer.\"\n\nIn a 2002 review for the AML blog, William Morris wrote that the stories seemed innocent, and deserve readers who \"will interact intensely with the text, yet at the end, not draw any conclusions or insist on interpretation\".\n\n== Mentions in works about Mormon fiction ==\nIn his essay \"The Dawning of a Brighter Day: Mormon Literature after 150 Years\", Eugene England mentioned Nothing Very Important in connection with emerging good books in Mormon literature. In his introduction to Bright Angels and Familiars, England said that Nothing Very Important was, like Bread and Milk (1979) and Elders and Sisters (1977), a series of stories connected by a longer narrative. Bruce Jorgensen mentioned Nothing Very Important as \"the first entirely non-Utah-Idaho Mormon fiction\" in the Encyclopedia of Mormonism. Marilyn Brown referred to Bela Petsco as one of the best Mormon short story writers and noted his absence in the anthology Greening Wheat. In a summary of local fiction for The Daily Herald, Richard Cracroft mentioned Nothing Very Important along with Cory Davidson as recent \"regional best-sellers in a literary genre\" about missionary life. Cracroft also mentioned Petsco's book in a 1981 Ensign article in a section on current Mormon fiction, comparing it to Winesburg, Ohio by Sherwood Anderson.\"\"\""}

{"id": 22104, "revid": "1117293148", "src_inf": "== Court hierarchy ==\nThe Supreme Court sits at the apex of the New Zealand court hierarchy as the final appellate court. Cases may only go to the Supreme Court if it grants \"leave to appeal\". It generally hears appeals of considerable public interest, commercial significance, substantial miscarriages of justice or significant issues relating to the Treaty of Waitangi. The chief justice presides over the Supreme Court and is described in the Senior Courts Act 2016 as \"senior to all other judges\". Before the Supreme Court first met in 2004, the Privy Council in London served as the highest court.\n\nThe High Court and Court of Appeal are subordinate appellate courts. The High Court is also the highest court of first instance, primarily hearing complex cases or those cases which exceed the lower courts' jurisdiction. This includes all criminal trials for murder, manslaughter and treason. The District Court hears more than 95% of all criminal trials. The Family Court and Youth Court are specialist divisions of District Court, dealing with families and young people, respectively. Other specialist courts include: the Employment Court; the Environment Court; the Māori Land Court; the Māori Appellate Court; and disputes tribunals, which are small claims courts. The Waitangi Tribunal is a permanent commission of inquiry established under the Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975.\n\n== Law ==\nNew Zealand practices the common law legal system, where the decisions of higher courts constitute binding precedent upon courts of equal or lower status within their jurisdiction, as opposed to the civil law legal system in the continental Europe.\n\nThe laws of New Zealand are based on English law, some older statutes of the British Parliament (notably the Bill of Rights 1689), statutes of the New Zealand Parliament, and decisions of the New Zealand courts. The laws are based on three related principles: parliamentary sovereignty, the rule of law, and the separation of powers. In interpreting common law, New Zealand judges have followed British decisions, although they are not bound by them, thereby preserving uniformity with British common law, bolstered by the long-term role of the Privy Council.\n\n== Judges ==\nThe chief justice is formally appointed by the governor-general on the recommendation of the prime minister. The judges of the Māori Land Court are appointed by the governor-general on the recommendation of the minister for Māori Development. All other superior court judges are appointed by the governor-general on the advice of the attorney-general, the chief justice, and the solicitor-general collectively.\n\nJudges and judicial officers are appointed non-politically and under strict rules regarding tenure to help maintain judicial independence from the executive government. Judges are appointed according to their qualifications, personal qualities, and relevant experience. New Zealand does not have a judicial appointments commission as in many other democracies. As for removal from the bench, judges have only rarely been removed from the bench in New Zealand. A judge may not be removed from office except by the attorney-general upon an address of the House of Representatives (Parliament) for proved misbehaviour.\n\nJudges of the Supreme Court, Court of Appeal and High Court are titled \"Justice\", while those of lower courts are titled \"Judge\". Judges in New Zealand are addressed as \"Your Honour\" or \"Sir/Madam\". In Commonwealth tradition, New Zealand judges do not use gavels. Instead, a judge raises his or her voice (or stands up if necessary) to restore order in the courtroom.\n\n== Languages used in court ==\nIn addition to English, Te Reo Māori and New Zealand Sign Language are official languages of New Zealand. Either official language may be used by any person or in any pleading or process in or issuing from a court. Any party wishing to do so must notify the court 10 working days in advance to ensure an interpreter is available, or the court will be adjourned until an interpreter can be found and the party may be liable for costs of the adjournment and delay.\n\n== History ==\nA Supreme Court was first established in 1841 followed by various lower courts including District Courts and Magistrates' Courts, with the latter coming into being in 1846. The Court of Appeal was set up in 1862 as the highest court in New Zealand, but consisted of panels of judges from the Supreme Court. Appeals could be taken from the Court of Appeal to the Privy Council. The District Courts were abolished in 1925 but later re-established. In 1957 the Court of Appeal was fully separated from the Supreme Court, by having its own judges.\n\nThe Native Land Court was established in 1865 under the Native Lands Act, to \"define the land rights of Māori people under Māori custom and to translate those rights or customary titles into land titles recognisable under European law\". The court was criticised for enabling the removal of Māori from their land, partly due to holding proceedings in English and in cities far from Māori settlements, judges with inadequate knowledge of Māori custom, and partly due to the laws it enforced. Land law did not recognise that land was owned communally by hapū (clans), and land ownership was put in the hands of a few people. In 1954 it was renamed the Māori Land Court. In the 1980s the judiciary played a major role in redefining and elevating the constitutional position of the Treaty of Waitangi.\n\nIn 1980, the Supreme Court was renamed the High Court (as it called today), reflecting its intermediate role. In October 2003, Parliament passed the Supreme Court Act 2003, establishing a new Supreme Court of New Zealand in Wellington in July 2004, and simultaneously ending the right of appeal to the Privy Council. The Privy Council dealt with only a small number of appeals annually and was shared with some other Commonwealth nations; the new Supreme Court allows for a quicker appeals process as more cases are heard. In October 2016, the Senior Courts Act consolidated in a single statute the Judicature Act of 1908 and the Supreme Court Act, which were repealed.\n\n== Indigenous courts ==\nIn Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States, Indigenous peoples are over-represented in the prison population.

Article:\n\n\"\"\"== Court hierarchy ==\nThe Supreme Court sits at the apex of the New Zealand court hierarchy as the final appellate court. Cases may only go to the Supreme Court if it grants \"leave to appeal\". It generally hears appeals of considerable public interest, commercial significance, substantial miscarriages of justice or significant issues relating to the Treaty of Waitangi. The chief justice presides over the Supreme Court and is described in the Senior Courts Act 2016 as \"senior to all other judges\". Before the Supreme Court first met in 2004, the Privy Council in London served as the highest court.\n\nThe High Court and Court of Appeal are subordinate appellate courts. The High Court is also the highest court of first instance, primarily hearing complex cases or those cases which exceed the lower courts' jurisdiction. This includes all criminal trials for murder, manslaughter and treason. The District Court hears more than 95% of all criminal trials. The Family Court and Youth Court are specialist divisions of District Court, dealing with families and young people, respectively. Other specialist courts include: the Employment Court; the Environment Court; the Māori Land Court; the Māori Appellate Court; and disputes tribunals, which are small claims courts. The Waitangi Tribunal is a permanent commission of inquiry established under the Treaty of Waitangi Act 1975.\n\n== Law ==\nNew Zealand practices the common law legal system, where the decisions of higher courts constitute binding precedent upon courts of equal or lower status within their jurisdiction, as opposed to the civil law legal system in the continental Europe.\n\nThe laws of New Zealand are based on English law, some older statutes of the British Parliament (notably the Bill of Rights 1689), statutes of the New Zealand Parliament, and decisions of the New Zealand courts. The laws are based on three related principles: parliamentary sovereignty, the rule of law, and the separation of powers. In interpreting common law, New Zealand judges have followed British decisions, although they are not bound by them, thereby preserving uniformity with British common law, bolstered by the long-term role of the Privy Council.\n\n== Judges ==\nThe chief justice is formally appointed by the governor-general on the recommendation of the prime minister. The judges of the Māori Land Court are appointed by the governor-general on the recommendation of the minister for Māori Development. All other superior court judges are appointed by the governor-general on the advice of the attorney-general, the chief justice, and the solicitor-general collectively.\n\nJudges and judicial officers are appointed non-politically and under strict rules regarding tenure to help maintain judicial independence from the executive government. Judges are appointed according to their qualifications, personal qualities, and relevant experience. New Zealand does not have a judicial appointments commission as in many other democracies. As for removal from the bench, judges have only rarely been removed from the bench in New Zealand. A judge may not be removed from office except by the attorney-general upon an address of the House of Representatives (Parliament) for proved misbehaviour.\n\nJudges of the Supreme Court, Court of Appeal and High Court are titled \"Justice\", while those of lower courts are titled \"Judge\". Judges in New Zealand are addressed as \"Your Honour\" or \"Sir/Madam\". In Commonwealth tradition, New Zealand judges do not use gavels. Instead, a judge raises his or her voice (or stands up if necessary) to restore order in the courtroom.\n\n== Languages used in court ==\nIn addition to English, Te Reo Māori and New Zealand Sign Language are official languages of New Zealand. Either official language may be used by any person or in any pleading or process in or issuing from a court. Any party wishing to do so must notify the court 10 working days in advance to ensure an interpreter is available, or the court will be adjourned until an interpreter can be found and the party may be liable for costs of the adjournment and delay.\n\n== History ==\nA Supreme Court was first established in 1841 followed by various lower courts including District Courts and Magistrates' Courts, with the latter coming into being in 1846. The Court of Appeal was set up in 1862 as the highest court in New Zealand, but consisted of panels of judges from the Supreme Court. Appeals could be taken from the Court of Appeal to the Privy Council. The District Courts were abolished in 1925 but later re-established. In 1957 the Court of Appeal was fully separated from the Supreme Court, by having its own judges.\n\nThe Native Land Court was established in 1865 under the Native Lands Act, to \"define the land rights of Māori people under Māori custom and to translate those rights or customary titles into land titles recognisable under European law\". The court was criticised for enabling the removal of Māori from their land, partly due to holding proceedings in English and in cities far from Māori settlements, judges with inadequate knowledge of Māori custom, and partly due to the laws it enforced. Land law did not recognise that land was owned communally by hapū (clans), and land ownership was put in the hands of a few people. In 1954 it was renamed the Māori Land Court. In the 1980s the judiciary played a major role in redefining and elevating the constitutional position of the Treaty of Waitangi.\n\nIn 1980, the Supreme Court was renamed the High Court (as it called today), reflecting its intermediate role. In October 2003, Parliament passed the Supreme Court Act 2003, establishing a new Supreme Court of New Zealand in Wellington in July 2004, and simultaneously ending the right of appeal to the Privy Council. The Privy Council dealt with only a small number of appeals annually and was shared with some other Commonwealth nations; the new Supreme Court allows for a quicker appeals process as more cases are heard. In October 2016, the Senior Courts Act consolidated in a single statute the Judicature Act of 1908 and the Supreme Court Act, which were repealed.\n\n== Indigenous courts ==\nIn Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States, Indigenous peoples are over-represented in the prison population. There have been calls to increase measures to reduce the level of incarceration in New Zealand, based on principles of therapeutic jurisprudence and restorative justice, and similar to specialist courts and processes for Indigenous peoples in Canada and Australia.\n\nTe Kooti Rangatahi is an Indigenous court for young Māori people, based on the marae, and has shown some success. Māori culture (tikanga Māori) and community members are integrated with the existing judicial process, to help young offenders connect with their culture.\n\nTe Kooti Matariki, the Matariki Court, is an Indigenous court for adults within a mainstream court system, under the District Court of New Zealand and operating under the Sentencing Act 2002. Based in Kaikohe, Northland Region, this court incorporates Māori customs and culture. Some of these differences from mainstream courts include including the offender's family in court proceedings; seating the offender at the same level as the judge and prosecutor; and a Kaumātua (elder) helps to determine the court proceedings, which begin with welcome speeches. By incorporating tikanga, more information is forthcoming from family members, with the collective knowledge of an offender's whanau (extended family) providing far more information than in formal court proceedings. The offender’s iwi (nation), hapū (clan) and whānau may all help to create an appropriate rehabilitation program for the offender, which, upon successful completion, will be taken into account in the final sentence. A 2011 article by Joanna Hess suggested that New Zealand should adopt some of the practices of Australian Indigenous courts, in particular the Koori Court in the state of Victoria, which has Indigenous sentencing courts as a separate division of the local court system.\"\"\""}

Members then, as now, come from two districts, Gaoyao District and Gaoming District, in Guangdong Province in China. A temple named Hung Fook Tong serving the community originating from Gaoyao and Gaoming (hence Yiu-Ming, from the second syllables of the two place names) was first built in Arncliffe in 1870. However, the temple was small and could not accommodate all attendees, so the Gaoyao-Gaoming community began raising funds in 1904 to purchase a larger plot of land for the temple. In 1908, land was purchased in Alexandria to build a community hall and a new temple to be called the Hung Sheng Gong, with some houses adjacent to the temple retained to be leased at low rents to new arrivals from Gaoyao-Gaoming or elderly community members who were unable to return to China. The Hung Sheng Gong is so-named because the principal deity worshiped is the sea god Hung Shing.\n\nThe 1880s-era rate books of the Municipality of Alexandria list many Chinese community members. By 1890, it was estimated that about 100 Chinese community members lived in Retreat Street.\n\nConstruction of the temple took place c. 1908–1909, with further work to the interior in 1917. The temple's figurative ceramic roof titles were imported from Foshan ceramic works. Two private companies, Tiy Loy and Co. and Wah Hing and Co. were established by society members, with premises on Botany Road, adjacent to Retreat Street. Society records from 1910 also list members in Rose Bay, Botany, northern Sydney, Canberra, Bombala and Newcastle. During the 20th century, attendees at the temple extended beyond the Gaoyao-Gaoming community to include Chinese migrants from other counties in Guangdong province.\n\nIn the 1980s, society membership increased dramatically as a result of increased Chinese immigration. In May 1981, the pailou and tile-capped wall were added to the temple, enclosing Retreat Street. In 1990, the Committee for the Yiu Ming Society was formed, with the first committee members elected, replacing an earlier system where officials were appointed. The name of the Society was changed and shortened from Yiu Ming Hung Fook Tong Society to Yiu Ming Society.\n\nIn 1995–96, conservation documentation of both the temple and Retreat Street was completed. A fire broke out in the temple in December 1996, but was quickly extinguished. In 1997–98, the building and associated objects were restored and cleaned in conjunction with community artisans and architects as well as Powerhouse Museum staff, informed by the earlier conservation documentation. The temple roof was replicated using imported Chinese tiles. Damaged timber panels from the temple interior were restored. Undamaged wooden items were cleaned. The main light fitting of the temple was reconstructed around the original frame. The altar table, which was completely destroyed, was replaced. The altar itself was cleaned and the central painting was re-painted. The temple was re-wired and repainted. The garden was tiled. The main burner of the temple was moved outside to minimise smoke damage and the sunken floor area which housed it has been filled in by the addition of removable timber panels. The temple reopened around Chinese New Year in 1998–99. Around that time, the associated terrace houses were refurbished, improving living conditions for the elderly residents.\n\n== Description ==\nThe temple remains much as it was when originally built. Most of the internal fittings date from this time. The temple walls are of red-faced brick, originally tuck pointed. The internal floor is of tessellated tiles with a white marble edging. Many internal details are of timber. The area is lit and ventilated by a \"roof lantern\" over a sunken floor section designed for burning incense and oil. Doors and fittings, including the main altar, are original.\n\nThe physical fabric of the temple and its associated objects retain evidence of the historical, architectural, social and spiritual significance of this site.\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nThe temple is of historical, architectural, religious and social significance to a section of Sydney's Chinese community. The Yiu Ming is one of the oldest and largest Chinese Societies. For approximately 130 years, the temple and its community and environment have provided practical assistance and spiritual support for community members seeking to establish themselves in Australia. Architecturally, the building is significant for its blending of traditional design, local materials and Federation detailing. The building has not been significantly modified since construction. The most significant modifications, following recent fire damage, replicated original form and materials as much as possible. The elaborate fittings of the temple provide evidence of community commitment to the temple and also demonstrate the skill of Chinese artisans at the beginning of the 20th century. As many village temples in China no longer exist, this fine, intact example is considered to be of both local and international significance.\n\nYiu Ming Temple was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 24 September 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.\n\nThe place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.\n\nThe site has a recorded history of continuous Chinese occupation since the 1870s. The temple and many fittings and associated objects have remained substantially intact. The site and the temple are associated with many significant Chinese community members. These include Sam Warley, who operated a large import business with branches in Perth and Hong Kong, John Hoe, who operated a large timber business and formed the NSW Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Deen Bong, a successful cabinet maker who was an early manager of Tiy Loy and Co. Many society members have been influential in the introduction, growing, marketing and distribution of Chinese vegetables and food. Society members have also helped to maintain Chinese festivals and celebrations, including the lion dance.\n\nThe place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.\n\nIt represents a unique blend of Chinese temple design and Federation detailing. It seems likely that Federation detailing drew heavily on the decorative elements of the Chinese building tradition. The building is an example of the aesthetic of village temples. Standardised building codes and systems meant that temples build outside China strongly resemble those built within China. Exposed rafters and purlins demonstrate traditional Chinese roof structure and demonstrate the flexibility of this system. The highly coloured decorative paintwork used throughout is a very strong aesthetic statement the figurative ceramic roof ridge tiles are a very strong element of the external architecture of the temple. The interior fittings and objects, commissioned from China, represent excellent examples of Chinese decorative arts at the time the temple was built. Many similar pieces have been destroyed in China so that the aesthetic significance of this material is very high.\n\nThe place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.\n\nThe complex has remained a cultural, religious and social centre for the community. The temple society has assisted community members, especially those newly arrived in Australia, by providing low cost housing, financial support and employment opportunities. This support was especially important when government policy meant that many community members were forced to live with only irregular contact with partners and families, who were still in China. Before the practice was banned, following the Chinese Revolution of 1949, Society members also arranged to return the bones of dead members to China for burial. Painted panels inside the temple list donors at the time of construction of the temple. These panels often refer to loyalty, brotherhood and the wish for happiness, prosperity and longevity. Many current Society members are able to identify the names of grandfathers, great uncles and other forebears on these panels and in the written records of the Society. The temple strongly communicates a sense of community identity and continuity. The Yiu Ming temple siting, orientation and layout follow principles of Chinese cosmology commonly known as feng shui. The main deity of the temple is Hong Sheng. \"god of the southern seas\". Hong Sheng is not a common deity either for Chinese Australians or for people from southern China. Cai Shen and Guan Di are other gods represented in the temple. The temple iconography includes much Daoist symbolism, including representations of the 8 Immortals and 8 precious things.

It also demonstrates the internationally recognised versatility and innovative skills of Chinese carpenters during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Joshua Ruley and Robinson had four sons and two daughters, of which Ellis Ruley was the oldest. According to Diane Laiscell, a great granddaughter of Ellis Ruley, Ruley did not spend much time in school as he had to start working at an early age to help support his family.\n\nJoshua Ruley married Eudora Robinson, who was born in Kingston, Rhode Island. According to Ellis Ruley’s great granddaughters, Delois C. Lindsey and Sheila L. Traynum, Robinson was born in 1851 and was of mixed African-American and Native American descent. One account describes Joshua Ruley as a runaway slave who was born in Wilmington, Delaware in 1847 before escaping North at the end of the Civil War. Laiscell disagrees saying “What Joshua did and how he arrived in Norwich, we will never know. There is very little information about Joshua’s life.”\n\n== Adult life ==\nRuley worked in construction and the remains of stone walls he built can still be found on his old homestead. Ruley was married twice. His first marriage was to Ida Bee, who died shortly after their daughter Marion was born in 1912. Ruley married a second time in 1933, to Wilhelmina Fox. The marriage was very unusual for the time, as Wilhelmina was white, and had been previously married to Ruley's brother, Amos Ruley.\n\nIn 1933, using part of the $8,500 he received in compensation for a work related truck accident, Ruley purchased 20 Hammond Avenue (now 28 Hammond Avenue) and began repairing the existing hundred-year-old house. Ruley renovated the property and installed gardens where he raised his own food. Diane Laiscell remembers him painting the animals and the forest surrounding his home.\n\nBy the 1950s Ruley was retired from work. During that time he endured racially hostile neighbors whom Laiscell remembers harassing their family. When Ruley died on January 16, 1959, \"there was a strong feeling in the black community of Norwich that he had met with foul play.\"\n\n== Artistic career ==\nIt is unclear when Ruley started to paint, since his work is undated. The art collector Glenn Palmedo-Smith estimates the year as \"roughly 1939\". By 1950, Ruley had met Joseph Gualtieri who was then Director of the Slater Memorial Museum. Gualtieri sponsored Ruley's sole art exhibit during his lifetime in December 1952. Ruley also participated in the annual outdoor art exhibit, \"Art in the Open\", sponsored by the Norwich Art School, where he would sell his paintings for $15 each. Gualtieri traveled to New York City in the early 1950s with some of Ruley's paintings to try to place them with art dealers, but was not successful; this did not seem to greatly disappoint Ruley.\n\nIt is unknown how many paintings Ruley created during his lifetime, or how many survive. Glenn Palmedo-Smith documented 62 surviving paintings in his 1993 book, Discovering Ellis Ruley. According to the City of Norwich's Ellis Walter Ruley Committee, by 2015, this number had increased to 64 paintings.\n\n== Artistic style ==\nRuley often painted scenes from everyday life in Norwich. According to Joseph Gualtieri, Ruley \"always worked in house paint, painting subject matter that varied from wild animals – with a preference for lions—to bathing beauties, pastoral landscapes, cowboys, and Indians.\" Ruley had no technical training in painting, so his works generally exhibit a simple style. His work has been described by Glenn Palmedo-Smith as \"otherworldly\", as though the images were \"captured from dreams\". In Palmedo-Smith's opinion, Ruley's work captures complex narratives with simple imagery.\n\n== Death ==\nEllis Ruley was found dead on the morning of January 17, 1959, on Hammond Avenue \"about 200 feet from his house\". His body was partly frozen. The Town Medical Examiner's opinion was that Ruley \"died from exposure, although he lost considerable blood from a gash on the head\". The Coroner believed Ruley's death was an accident.\n\nThe Norwich Police Department learned that Ruley had been at a restaurant in Norwich the previous evening, where he had been drinking. \"He left the place in a taxi cab at 7pm, was driven to Hammond Avenue and helped to within 25 feet of his home by the cab driver.\"\n\nAccording to the investigation that followed Ruley's death, the gash on his head was the result of falling and hitting his head on a stone wall. He was thought to be walking to or from his house. A local paper at the time reported that \"Ruley, judging from the trail of blood extending for a distance of nearly 100 feet attempted to regain his feet but apparently lost all sense of direction. Stones in the wall were spattered with blood and it appeared that Ruley then staggered or stumbled in a circle and down a grade, back onto the Hammond road extension where he collapsed.\"\n\nMembers of Ruley's family were very suspicious, and believed that Ruley may have been murdered, possibly by a neighbor who wanted his property, or as a result of racial animosity. Supporting their suspicions were the earlier death of Douglas Harris, Ellis Ruley’s son-in-law, in 1948, who was found head first down a well on the property, and an unexplained fire which destroyed Ruley’s home after his death. Harris's death was found to be an accident by authorities at the time. An autopsy in 2014 by Dr. Michael Baden, a forensic pathologist, however, discovered that Harris's hyoid bone had been broken, indicating that he had been strangled prior to his death.\n\nAfter performing an autopsy on Ruley, Baden determined that Ruley could have collapsed due to \"some cardiac abnormality or from his brain disease\" but also stated that it is possible that he could have been pushed by someone else, possibly the result of a robbery or altercation. He concluded that we cannot determine how Ruley actually fell on the night of his death. Because the circumstances surrounding Ruley's death are uncertain, Baden concluded that Ruley's death \"cannot be categorized as a homicide.\" Baden also noted that Ruley's empty wallet had been found on Hammond Avenue about 20 feet from his body.\n\nIn 2019, Samuel Browning, a local attorney, presented his findings on Ruley's death concluding, \"There are troubling unanswered questions concerning the facts that surround his demise... but I do not have enough evidence to prove he was murdered.\" In Browning's opinion, the main problem with considering Ruley's death an accident is that while the cab driver who brought Ruley home \"claimed he had dropped him off at the top of the hill, and watched him approach the door of the home... in winter a cab driver would not likely have braved the steep gravel driveway, and was more likely to have dropped him off on the road.\" Browning thought the cab driver, a friend of cousin Harry E. Ruley Jr, had lied about where he had dropped Ruley off, perhaps because of embarrassment after Ruley was later found dead.\n\n== Rediscovery, acclaim, and commemoration ==\nIn 1984, Glenn Palmedo-Smith found Ruley's painting Adam and Eve while at the antique market in Brimfield, Massachusetts. He was struck by the painting, claiming he had \"glimpsed something wonderful, and a little sad, and more than a little mesmerizing.\" At the time Palmedo-Smith did not know who the artist was; he only discovered Ruley’s name and background through subsequent research that took him to Norwich Connecticut, where Mr. Gualtieri identified the painting, and told Palmedo-Smith it used to hang over Ruley’s couch.\n\nAfter years of research, Palmedo-Smith wrote the book, Discovering Ellis Ruley, which provided photographic plates of all known Ruley works. The book was used as the catalog for a national tour of Ruley paintings that was underwritten by the Ford Motor Company and the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation. The exhibit opened in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1995 and had shows in museums in San Diego, Washington, D.C., New Orleans, New York City and Hartford, Connecticut.\n\nIn the 2010s, there was a renewal of interest in the art and life of Ruley. Best-selling author and Norwich native, Wally Lamb, wrote a character modeled on Ellis Ruley in his 2013 book, We are Water.\n\nIn September 2015, the City of Norwich passed a resolution creating an Ellis Walter Ruley Committee to commemorate the local artist. The committee raised the money to create a park on the site of Ruley’s old homestead at 28 Hammond Avenue. After supervising construction, the committee had the park dedicated on July 27, 2018. From September 23 through December 7, 2018, the Slater Memorial Museum in Norwich, Connecticut featured an exhibit with eighteen of Ruley’s paintings.\n\nAs of July 2018, Glenn Palmedo-Smith was working on \"a documentary about Ruley's life, art and his death\" titled Unruley.

An autopsy in 2014 by Dr. Michael Baden, a forensic pathologist, however, discovered that Harris's hyoid bone had been broken, indicating that he had been strangled prior to his death.\n\nAfter performing an autopsy on Ruley, Baden determined that Ruley could have collapsed due to \"some cardiac abnormality or from his brain disease\" but also stated that it is possible that he could have been pushed by someone else, possibly the result of a robbery or altercation. He concluded that we cannot determine how Ruley actually fell on the night of his death. Because the circumstances surrounding Ruley's death are uncertain, Baden concluded that Ruley's death \"cannot be categorized as a homicide.\" Baden also noted that Ruley's empty wallet had been found on Hammond Avenue about 20 feet from his body.\n\nIn 2019, Samuel Browning, a local attorney, presented his findings on Ruley's death concluding, \"There are troubling unanswered questions concerning the facts that surround his demise... but I do not have enough evidence to prove he was murdered.\" In Browning's opinion, the main problem with considering Ruley's death an accident is that while the cab driver who brought Ruley home \"claimed he had dropped him off at the top of the hill, and watched him approach the door of the home... in winter a cab driver would not likely have braved the steep gravel driveway, and was more likely to have dropped him off on the road.\" Browning thought the cab driver, a friend of cousin Harry E. Ruley Jr, had lied about where he had dropped Ruley off, perhaps because of embarrassment after Ruley was later found dead.\n\n== Rediscovery, acclaim, and commemoration ==\nIn 1984, Glenn Palmedo-Smith found Ruley's painting Adam and Eve while at the antique market in Brimfield, Massachusetts. He was struck by the painting, claiming he had \"glimpsed something wonderful, and a little sad, and more than a little mesmerizing.\" At the time Palmedo-Smith did not know who the artist was; he only discovered Ruley’s name and background through subsequent research that took him to Norwich Connecticut, where Mr. Gualtieri identified the painting, and told Palmedo-Smith it used to hang over Ruley’s couch.\n\nAfter years of research, Palmedo-Smith wrote the book, Discovering Ellis Ruley, which provided photographic plates of all known Ruley works. The book was used as the catalog for a national tour of Ruley paintings that was underwritten by the Ford Motor Company and the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation. The exhibit opened in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1995 and had shows in museums in San Diego, Washington, D.C., New Orleans, New York City and Hartford, Connecticut.\n\nIn the 2010s, there was a renewal of interest in the art and life of Ruley. Best-selling author and Norwich native, Wally Lamb, wrote a character modeled on Ellis Ruley in his 2013 book, We are Water.\n\nIn September 2015, the City of Norwich passed a resolution creating an Ellis Walter Ruley Committee to commemorate the local artist. The committee raised the money to create a park on the site of Ruley’s old homestead at 28 Hammond Avenue. After supervising construction, the committee had the park dedicated on July 27, 2018. From September 23 through December 7, 2018, the Slater Memorial Museum in Norwich, Connecticut featured an exhibit with eighteen of Ruley’s paintings.\n\nAs of July 2018, Glenn Palmedo-Smith was working on \"a documentary about Ruley's life, art and his death\" titled Unruley. Delois C. Lindsey was also working on her own documentary based on her book.\"\"\""}
