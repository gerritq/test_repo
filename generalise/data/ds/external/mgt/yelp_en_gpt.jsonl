{"trgt": "Review for the Lounge/Club:\\nEvery time I go to Vegas this is always one of my stops- primarily because of the view. I started going years ago before it was super hyped up and packed almost all the time. I also remember the days when the Witch Doctors were twice the size they are now (and weaker than they used to be!). Voodoo hasn't changed much in the past 5 years except going cheap on the drinks and over packing the club with VIP sections that are unused (which is totally annoying if you're trying to see the view without a bunch of drunk asses running into you). \\n\\nThe DJs are consistently good and it has a very, very mixed crowd. However, I only keep coming back for the view- it doesn't compare to anything else. Ghost Bar has nothing on this place. \\n\\nAlso, over the years the award winning flair bartending has leveled off (I think I saw one bottle throw the whole time we were there) and it's not nearly the show it used to be which is really disappointing. If you ever have a chance to catch the episode of Three Sheets on Spike where Zane goes to Vegas- you'll see what I mean. The show was filmed several years ago and even there you can see the Witch Doctor and the flair are way better than they are now. \\n\\nFor newcomers I think this is a great place to at least see once just because the view is so amazing. However, for those who have been going back over and over again- it's turning into a huge disappointment. \\n\\nFor the Restaurant:\\n\\nI've dined here several times and price-wise it runs about the same as any other high end steak house you'd find on the strip. Mostly we ate here out of convenience since the selection at Rio isn't the greatest for food. The service has been reasonably decent and the food was good however, if dinner is going to cost around $100 a person I want to be wowed. The whole experience didn't seem like a 5 star dining like when we went to Strip House (wow! by the way). The servers were friendly but only slightly knowledgeable about the wine list and it seemed like there wasn't enough coverage for the tables which made dinner take forever. I don't really remember much more than that which is disappointing because I wish it were more memorable for the price paid. Been there, done that- won't be back to Voodoo Steak when there's so many better options for the same price.", "beginning": "Review for the Lounge/Club:\\nEvery time I go to Vegas this", "mgt": "Review for the Lounge/Club:  \nEvery time I go to Vegas, this place is a must-visit.

{"trgt": "I went to Sole on the weekend and found that it was so crowded and noisy I thought I would wait till later.  What better night to feed my paella hungrys than tonight when it rained cats and dogs - I was seated immediately and the noise level was bearable.  I ordered a house salad, paella Valenciana, thought I might have a dessert after.  I was served a very small roll with a small piece of very cold, hard butter and waited.  The salad was better than the standard peter rabbit variety of lettuce with a slice of tomato and was not ice cold, certainly a plus.  The paella came in a traditional paella dish with, I kid you not, three small clams, three muscles, a few pieces of squid, and a few shrimp.  The rice had little saffron flavor. The Sofrito  was extremely bland with little of the spices that one associates with this dish.  Basically Sole prepares this \\\"all at once\\\" so the flavors have little or no chance to \\\"marry up\\\" and the sea food being overcooked is rubbery. In other words you must \\\"reserve\\\" the sea food and add it back in at the last moment.  As for the rice it should not be disturbed at the end of cooking so the socarrat (a crispy caramelized rice) can form in the bottom of the pan (See recipe below).  I think if you can buy canned paella and warm it up in a microwave it might be a close approximation of this abomination.  On the way out I was asked  about how I liked my meal.  When I proceeded to explain to him why I was so disappointed he ask first where I had eaten  paella and suggested that next time i should probably eat it some where else.  At no time was I rude to this person and I was frankly astonished at his attitude.  So to all you yelpers I suggest that you too might want to consider trying to find real Spanish food somewhere else.  For my friend at Sole I hope that even though he assures me that never in 8 years has he had a complaint about their  paella he will take the time next time to have the real thing at either of the fine restaurants that I have referenced in NYC.  He might also like to check out this recipe- noting the importance of the socarrat, the Sofrito, and the gradual \\\"building\\\" of the paella\\n\\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/el-charro-espanol-new-york#query:spanish%20food\\n\\nThis restaurant is a treasure and has been  serving a very special crowd for over thirty years.\\n\\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/socarrat-paella-bar-new-york\\nFor those who are not quiet as adventuresome as might be demanded by tiny little el Charro this is one of NY's best Spanish restaurants.\\n\\nhttp://www.paellapans.com/Paella-Recipe-Seafood-a/142.htm\\nThis is close to the paella that I am accustomed to eating at el-Charro's -  note the emphasis on the proper forming of the Socarrat\\n\\nRegardless of all this.

I didn't think it was anything spectacular though. If you like thin crust, this might be for you. It reminded me of Sbarro, except a little better.

I might have liked it more if there was a bit more sauce.

{"trgt": "In order to not write a hateful review, I had to bring myself to the realization that this place is supposed to be a 'healthy' buffet, not a 'good' buffet. \\nI had never been here before, so I was delighted to see it was indeed a buffet. But as I got halfway down the first island of stuff, the delight turned into trepidation. At the cashier, which is at the end of your first go-round, she said $11.98 and I looked at my plate. \\\"For this?\\\" I wanted to ask. Wisely, I did not, for that is when I saw the other side of the buffet. There were warming lights and an actual kitchen back there, so I figured that must be where the meat is. I paid, however still leery. \\nI sat my salad down and hurried over to the hot stuff. Soups, alright. Breads with cheese on it, cool. Pastas, ok. Meats? No. Crap. \\nSo I knew I'd be eating 'healthy'. I could use more of that. I didn't complain too much. \\nAll the salad stuff was fresh. Whether it was good or not will depend upon your taste in salad stuff. They've got a variety toppings, so you probably will create something to your liking. They seemed to have all the bases covered with the dressings, too...and the low-fat honey mustard dressing doesn't taste too low-fat, so don't avoid it. There's also oils and vinaigrette in bottles. I will say that for a place that specializes in salads, it seemed that they could have had even more toppings to offer...no ham, no turkey, no avocado, no mozzarella, no blahblahblah... I honestly have seen more offerings at a Ruby Tuesday salad bar. \\nAs for the specially prepared salads, most people will find something tasty. I had the Caesar salad, the pineapple coleslaw, tarragon tuna something, and some chicken and rice thing. The best was the Caesar, which was especially fresh and had garlic croutons. The pineapple coleslaw was as refreshing a dish as I think I've ever had. The tuna and the chicken/rice thing was just ok to me...but I still must point out how fresh it all was. \\nThe soups were delicious. I tried the shrimp bisque and the Mexican soup (can't remember the name). The bisque was awesome as I had two bowls of it, creamy with a subtle flavor and plenty of shrimp. The Mexican soup was the meatiest thing there and had a great rustic taste. Neither soup was greasy or too heavy. \\nThe pasta was unremarkable. I had the lemon pasta with capers...all you tasted was a tang of lemon and absolutely nothing else. The pasta was well cooked, but just left you with no taste. I didn't bother with the mac and cheese, as I don't eat that at restaurants. Then there was the broccoli and cheese stuff...had too much of a twang to it, too sharp. I put it over the pasta to try and make something happen, the result was tasting nothing but the twang plus the tang. Uh uh. \\nOne of things I enjoyed the most was the asiago something something bread. It was nice and crusty, but soft somehow. And the taste was great...garlicy and the asiago cheesiness. Perfect with all the salad and even more so to sop up soup. There were other breads, but none looked as appetizing. I must say that they kept it nice and fresh, with at least 3 batches coming out while we were there. \\nDidn't try the yogurt or any of the deserts...should've. Oh well. \\nThere is also some darn good strawberry lemonade here. Its got real strawberries from the looks of it, because you can see the 'seeds' or whatever that stuff is in strawberries, all in the stuff. Either that or my glass was dirty... No, but it was great, and goes well with everything. \\nSomething else I'd like to mention is the service. The special salads had all been depleted, someone notified the cashier, the cashier immediately notified whoever, and they came over right away and began making fresh salads...which shows that there isn't some big vat in the back with premade stuff in it. The line was backing up, but the people making the salads were busting their butts. It was nice to see. \\nWill I go back? Probably not, just not my style of buffet, even though it really SHOULD replace my usual buffets. \\nShould you go? If you like salads a lot, and if you like soups a lot - then yes. Keep in mind that they only had 3 soups to choose from, and also some chili (didn't try). So that might not be enough variety for you. And you only get the pretty basic salad toppings. But its all fresh. Do not go here for the pasta. And I don't know what changes at dinner time, so maybe there's more variety then. \\nGood value? Yes, if you can get full off of salad and soup. Looking for a meal with more girth? No. $12 for no meat for a man who is looking for meat leaves a bad taste in the mouth. Don't know the prices for kids under whatever age, but there is a senior price. \\nIf you're smart enough to eat healthier, this is a decent place, but still doesn't seem to have enough stuff to choose from - that's my biggest gripe.

{"trgt": "The side of sauteed Spinach was incredibly salty otherwise the color was wonderful and it smelled great. The side of sauteed mushrooms looked really good, but they were way too peppery. I never season my food, when its cooked right there isn't any need to but whoever made those dishes had a very heavy hand. I NEVER leave food behind and I didn't even finish half of them. \\n\\nI had to ask for a steak knife. Waited until someone bothered to make eye contact with me to ask for it by the way. The steak was cooked perfectly - rare just the way I like it and the texture wonderful. The thin french fries were great too, very good! Flavor, texture etc. but as I ate the steak there was way too much seasoning on it as well. Seasoning shouldn't over power the flavor of a good cut of meat and this did. \\n\\nThe biggest issue I had: the staff really needs a lesson in professionalism. I heard one woman behind me talk about a female condom which was just PART of their conversation. They were all huddled in the back while there were people at tables on the floor. Totally turned me off. I saw waitress and waiter in disagreement in the middle of the dining area while setting up a table. One couple complained they had been sitting there ignored. The gentleman got up and said something to a waiter and the manager came over and appeared to make amends in a grandiose way.  My own waiter walked by and for some reason never made eye contact. I was not sure why  - to be clear I NEVER give anyone a hard time nor am I anything other than friendly. Even if the service and food are not up to par. \\n\\nI was seated in the back, on the left (if you are facing the kitchens) so had a birds eye view - and ear - to everything. I told one friend that I actually felt like I was in restaurant boss type episode and there was a hidden camera somewhere, it was that ridiculous with the staff and how they were acting. \\n\\nThe Manager must have realized I heard what I shouldn't have heard because he gave me a box of free pastries and apologized. The staff treated him, quite honestly? - like crap. It was embarrassing. The fact that those kids (some of them - others adults) acted in such a manner in a restaurant that I'd heard NOTHING but rave reviews about? It was disappointing. \\n\\nThe fact I heard him trying to discipline them - they ignored him - was probably not smart on his part either. He seemed frazzled and angry and just disgusted. Lets just say the atmosphere that night was a 1 star. If the staff acts up like that? Get them in the kitchen and send them home, don't do it where patrons can hear.\\n\\nIn all fairness maybe (hopefully for the owner) this was not a regular occurrence because friends of mine RAVE about this place. For breakfast and dinner saying it was one of their favorites. I went on a Coupon to try it out, and at first loved the atmosphere but it went downhill from there. I also can't see paying that kind of money for a meal that was \\\"eh\\\" \\n\\nI always eat every bite on my plate and I savor each one. I didn't take anything with me except the free pastries and my french fries. \\n\\nI judge a place on different criteria and I have a sensitive palate and nose. LOVE food. To cook it, eat it, buy it, read about it etc. I think I am a good judge of what I see, taste, smell and - hear.\\n\\nI'd recommend other places before this one for DINNER - may consider giving them a shot for breakfast type fare and will say the ONE WONDERFUL thing - the best thing about this place - the desserts. They were a little stale but it was after 9pm so that isn't a biggie in my book. \\n\\nI bought a slice of Carrot cake and Tiramisu - the waiter had closed my bill without asking me about desserts at all by the way......I watched a waitress across the room RAVE about them to a full table of people ( I was solo) and she had me craving them. He was going to give them to me for free because he closed the bill out. I insisted on paying for them and will tell you that it was \\\"THE BEST\\\" carrot cake I've ever had! I'd order a whole one for my birthday cake if I could. \\n\\nThe free pastries the Manager gave me? Macaroons are awesome almond cakes too and croissants with chocolate in them. I would recommend this place as a BAKERY and I may give them a shot - after hearing a friend say the crepes were really good - for breakfast. However, not my first choice or even second for Dinner. \\n\\nFor the owner?

We have had pizza, pasta, entrees, and sandwiches.  All of it was good (with the exception of one weird chicken parm), but the best thing is definitely the pizza!  We love their pizza, especially the Amante Special!  It is very very good!  The crust is tender and sturdy without taking over the whole pie.  The sauce is tasty but not overbearing.  There are always plenty of toppings on each slice.  The sandwiches come in a close second, with our favorite being the canadian bacon one - yum!  My wife says they have the BEST caesar salad she has ever had - sometimes she has to get 2 to satisfy her craving!

Of course I jumped on Yelp and went searching.  A friend had mentioned Onyx before so I looked it up.   Good reviews... and a special coupon to purchase.  $30 off for $15 seemed like a great deal so I bought it right here on Yelp and off I went to Onyx.\\n\\nWhen we arrived, the place seemed TOO quiet.  We parked right up front, across form the door, and in the shade.  We walked and turned away from the bar into the upscale Onyx.  YIKES!  Gone are the tablecloths, waiters, and customers.

He replies that it is but cautions me that the menu is much smaller and I might have trouble spending the $30 on my coupon.  Uh oh.  I thought about leaving, but I am already $15 invested into this meal.  \\n\\nNo more steaks or even entrees.  The menu consists of appetizers, pizza's, and sandwiches.  We order the crispy taco appetizer and onion soup to start.  The tacos were good... they should be as it took them 20 minutes to make.  The onion soup never came at all.  Then onto the main course.  We both order pizza's.  After a good 30 minutes....  THIRTY MINUTES....   the food arrives.  A word of warning...  if you order pizza here you better like parmigiana.  The pizza was LOADED with it.  It was really 90% of the taste.  The crust and sauce were OK... but they were overpowered.  Even if you love parmigiana, you are likely to be disappointed in the pizza.  They couldn't sell this in NY for a nickel.  \\n\\nOverall the food was disappointing and the atmosphere depressing.  No more live music.  No more tablecloths.  No more restaurant... really.  I guess they couldn't make it as a real restaurant and now are some sort of  cheap poker bar menu... but without the poker bar (unless you go to the other room... bogeys).

Did not have to wait to be seated since they were on the ball about that. We were served our drinks right away and headed to the food. Our waitress was friendly. She came to our table about 3 times during our meal (for each refill we had on our drinks). \\n\\n\\nMy favorite selection was definitely the jalapeno chicken. It was way spicier than I had assumed it would be, so it was a pleasant surprise. I loved it. It definitely blew the other chicken out of the water. Most of the others I tried were somewhat bland. Not much flavor at all really. I've had better general tso's at most other places. The sesame chicken tasted just like the general tso's. Not much flavor. The kung pao chicken probably had even less flavor than the general tso's chicken.\\n\\nI'm not a fan of sushi so I can't comment on Lin's sushi without saying I didn't like it. I don't like seafood in general. Though, the salmon they served was actually something I enjoyed. \\n\\nThe beef from beef and broccoli was okay. It was a little TOO tender, but some may enjoy it falling apart right away. I just like chewing my food instead of being able to just mush it down and swallow it. But not many complaints there.. The only other complaint I really have about the food was some of it was room temperature or cooler. But some was also very warm as they had just brought some out right before I grabbed it. \\n\\nThey have various fruits set out in the dessert section, but the melon wasn't completely ripe so it was a little hard still. Also, it wasn't very cold. I like cold watermelon, and it was warmer than room temperature so I was a little disappointed.

The thing that caused me to write the review was when I left and two hours later both big toes completely smudged due to gooey, thick polish. I called the salon- they said they do not guarantee polishes, just 7 days for gel. I said that was fine, most places don't, but they would normally fix a mistake especially within the first few hours. They told me to call back early tomorrow to talk to a manager. I did, manager wasn't there and was going to call me back that afternoon. Nothing. Called the next day same thing. Basically, I never heard from them again and then to make it even better my gel manicure chipped in two places within the 4th-6th day.

It is a dish that has a bit more bite - not spicy, but that I think it strikes a less sweet note and more of an earthy one.\\n\\nI've never personally tried any of the other dishes, but I've heard great things about the Ayam bakar, which is barbequed chicken breast in a peanut sauce.\\n\\nNOTE: Be sure to take advantage of the condiments next to the forks!  The hot sauce is great if you enjoy your food spicier and the sweet soy-based one is also delicious and would likely be a great accompaniment to the dishes with a thicker-looking peanut sauce to thin it out.\\n\\nAll the entrees come with acar, which is a lightly picked vegetable salad, and krupuk, which are crunchy tapioca puffs.

One thing that bothered me almost the whole meal was the lighting, which was very bright. Finally they turned it down at about 8:30 but it felt like a dining hall for a bit there.\\n\\nMonday night apparently is not a busy night for them, as we were one of three tables, and nobody was at the bar or grill.

I had to ask him to repeat himself and he turned it up, for a second, then turned it back down. Whatever. William, the restaurant manager was awesome as well, making me feel like he was privileged to have me there. We decided to just put them in charge and see what we got with both food and sake. \\n\\nThe first course, Butterfish, was delicious served with a ginger sauce and  some veggies. Second course of Tempura Rock Shrimp was not my favorite, but good. It had a bit of a Mexican flavor with chile and lime. The Pork Belly came next and this was by far my favorite dish, just absolutely perfectly cooked and very flavorful. I did not care for the next which were the chicken skewers. The main course of Rib Eye was average, and I wanted more pork belly. All of the sakes served to us were great, and dessert was wonderful as well. Foodwise, this was a near perfect evening, with only one dish really being blah, and that was the ribeye.\\n\\nI do hope they get busier soon, as they are going to be in trouble if last night was the norm.

{"trgt": "Third stop on an Aria/Crystals foodie crawl.  We sat down at the bar eager for some tapas and sangria.  I got a glass of red sangria ($4.50 - bargain!), which is my favorite sangria in all of Las Vegas.  Perfect spice to it.  Doesn't just taste like watered down red wine.  My husband got a glass of white wine, the Albarino ($9) which was good but a little sweet for my tastes.  I like dry white wine.\\n\\nWe went a little nuts and got three tapas!  I was really intrigued by the salmon truffle ($12) which is a piece of salmon with bechamel truffle sauce atop a portabello mushroom.  This was actually disappointingly ok.  Maybe I was all truffled out from the truffle fritters at Jean Georges but this dish just didn't do much for me.\\n\\nWe also got the oysters ($10) which the server said could be served with a mango foam or traditional.  This was confusing because the menu said gazpacho foam.  We went for the mango foam, but when we got them, it was definitely gazpacho foam.  Either way, they were very good and fresh.  The oysters come in servings of 4.\\n\\nFinally we got the pata negra ($35), which we always get here.  Now it is ham, some bread, and a tomato sauce, which may be a little offputting given the price.  But this is famous blackhoofed pig and only comes from Spain.  The ham is cured for 3 years and it is just so yummy.  The tomato sauce, which appears to be fresh tomatoes and olive oil, goes perfectly with the ham.\\n\\nA good experience but I was disappointed by the salmon so I'll drop off a star.  Plus, they got slammed towards the end of our meal (our server actually exclaimed out loud about being slammed, so it must have been bad) and it took a while to get the check.  No biggie.  Nice atmosphere and it's open to the casino so great people watching.\\n\\nCheck out the bathrooms for sure here.  They are left of the bar towards the back.  Ladies to the left, mens to the right.

{"trgt": "This isn't *just* a lunch review. I say that so you'll understand that Cowboy Ciao is also a great option for mid-day dining. Of course I want to go back for dinner and check out that menu, but all in good time...\\n\\nFor lunch, my hungry co-workers and I decided Cowboy Ciao was a fantastic Plan B (After Geisha so rudely dismissed us). Some of us were concerned about the price, but I figured I'd enjoy my lunch, no matter the cost, since it wasn't everyday that I get to dine at such well-received places. \\n\\nI ordered the Buffalo Carpaccio. It was on their \\\"light\\\" menu, with plates to share or options that won't leave you feeling overly stuffed. It was actually quite filling, with thin slices of seared buffalo, generous portions of goat cheese, a small green salad with beets and dried pieces of garlic bread (think upscale croutons). I loved everything but the dried bread. Oh well. It was soooo good, especially when combining the buffalo, goat cheese and green in a fork-full bite of pure enjoyment. \\n\\nMy friend got the famous (or infamous) Stetson Chopped Salad. Imagine my surprise when it was smoked salmon as the main meat - not beef, as I expected. Then again, when I think cowboy + stetson, I think beef. Wouldn't you? Turns out the salad isn't named in the cowboy theme (which is tastefully displayed in the decor) but for the name of the street. Ah-ha! Clever, Cowboy Ciao. You got me there. \\n\\nAnyhow, the salad, though small for a hungry luncher, was beautiful presented - all ingredients lined up in rows, then \\\"chopped\\\" right before your eyes! My co-worker was a bit disapponted in the size of the salad for $12. It's definitely not something you should order if you're really hungry!\\n\\nMy other co-worker ordered the daily special - an ENORMOUS sandwich that consisted of bacon, avocado, tomatoes, rooster (i forget the \\\"special culinary name\\\" for this) and toasted ciabatta bread. It was HUGE. Definitely a bargain for $10. I heard it was damn good, too. \\n\\nI also had a cup of their coffee. Yum. With fresh cream. I noticed it was a $3.00 cup, though. Dang. Next time I will accept the offer for a re-fill! \\n\\nSoooo... what's the verdict? Cowboy Ciao gets my seal of approval. It's a great place for lunch, especially if you decide to split a couple \\\"light\\\" plates. You may even opt for desert. How can you miss the delectable temptations, when they're the first thing on the menu you see? \\n\\nCowboy Ciao, I'm on to you. You want me to be one of the many customers leaving behind witty remarks, don't you? You want me doing back-flips like an Olympic gymnast on my way out the door? Well, like I said, I'm on to you. But don't worry. It's a good thing. You definitely won me over, especially since, with tip, I was able to have a wonderful, satisfying lunch here for $20. \\n\\nOh yeah, and Sean, our server, was A+. \\n\\nCan't wait to go back for dinner...", "beginning": "This isn't *just* a lunch review.

It wasn't the same for the tech doing my manicure. \\n\\nWhen I sat down, she started small talk and wanted to know if I wanted my eye brows done. I said no and she said that she does brows.

I thought she might go back and clean it up, but she didn't.

{"trgt": "Their lack of service really outweighed the quality of their food, so for that I am giving them one star (I wish I could give none).\\n\\nThe waitresses thoroughly pissed both me and my bf off. First of all, we were the first people to go into the restaurant at 11am. Once we entered, they looked over at us from the bar and I said \\\"hello\\\" with a smile on my face, which was quickly turned into a scowl after they just stared at us without responding. We just stood their for 5 minutes while they kept on talking to each other at the bar. Then FINALLY one of them comes up to us and says \\\"yes, what can i help you with?\\\" \\\"um, we're here for breakfast\\\" is what we said. Then she told us to sit in the front without even bringing us over to a table. \\n\\nWe picked out what we wanted fairly quickly. We both got Cuban style breakfasts which were $8.95 each (pretty overpriced for what you get). My plate consisted of some plantains, two potato balls, two pieces of toast, and eggs....for $8.95. Which reminds me that they totally screwed up on my order. I ordered scrambled eggs and my boyfriend ordered his over easy. They brought us our plates (after about 20 minutes of waiting even though we were the only customers) and both plates had over easy eggs. I didn't even bother complaining because I knew it was just going to take even longer and we were on pressed time. I felt like they just did all the eggs over easy to make it simpler for themselves. \\n\\nMy bf finished his plate first and he scooted his empty plate to the side of the table so the waitress could see and pick it up. Instead the waitress sat some lady that just arrived to a booth next to us and started talking to her in Spanish for a while, took her order, then walked right past our table without taking the plate or giving us and refills. Shortly after that, I finished my plate of food. At that point there were TWO empty plates at the side of the table and TWO empty cups next to them. It really ticked me off to see the waitress bring the lady's order out right away, talk to her some MORE, then pass our table ONCE AGAIN without doing anything. We were literally sitting there doing nothing. \\n\\nThe waitress went to the lady's table again to talk to her some more and that's when my boyfriend asked her for the bill, then she asked us if we wanted some refills and took our plates. If that's what it takes to get refills and a clean table at this place then that's just ridiculous.\\n\\nShe came out with not our bill, but the bill for the lady in the booth next to us. WTF that really got us mad! That lady next to us arrived about 30 minutes after we arrived.  We asked for the bill ONCE AGAIN and she brought it out along with the other lady's change. My bf slammed his card on the bill right away cuz we were not in the mood to wait any longer. \\n\\nAs we waited for the waitress to bring us the receipt I noticed all the other waitresses just standing around the bar DOING NOTHING BUT TALKING TO EACH OTHER AND LOOKING AT THEMSELVES IN THE MIRROR. That's probably what they do all day long since the bar has a wall made up of mirrors. It was so annoying, there was about 5 other waitresses and not one of them could give us good service. I noticed one of the waitresses made a stripper outfit out of her uniform. All of her tramp stamp tattoos were showing since she rolled her shirt up and she was wearing hoochi shorts, I found it very unprofessional. \\n\\nOur receipt finally came. I begged my bf not to give a tip, unfortunately he did lol, but it was only 5 percent. They really deserved less considering they neglected the hell out of us . \\n\\nI don't know if it was because of the way we looked (my bf has dreads and I have a nose piercing) but the service was just horrible and it seemed like it was only like that for us. Either way, no establishment should be run like this. \\n\\nWe still want to try the Cuban buffet and we plan on doing so next week.

We ended up getting a short-rib dish, a fried noodle dish and a beef and rice noodle dish.\\n\\nThe short ribs were alright, they had a tasty, albeit very strong 5 spice seasoning to them and were a bit on the chewy side but the flavor was good.\\n\\nThe Fried Noodle dish was very tasty. The noodles were fried separately from the rest of the dish so they retained a crunchiness while eating them, the bok choy and gravy were very complementary of the various meats in the dish.\\n\\nThe spicy beef and rice noodle dish was ordered with some random greens added. I think they just threw in whatever was fresh. Either way, my brother and GF said they like that the best. The gravy was good and the beef was tasty. My favourite part was the choy sum, crunchy and delicious.\\n\\nThe place was pretty full when we walked in and got pretty loud with the other two large groups. Once one of the groups left the noise level decreased exponentially and the owner came out and started chatting it up with everyone still dining.\\n\\nAs stated in other reviews, there are many non-menu items/specials posted to the walls but they are all in Chinese so I will just leave that stuff to question (though they might be fun to try one day).", "beginning": "This place is a diamond in the rough.

{"trgt": "I recall when the first location opened on Craig rd., it was great and this became home for dinner, lunch and sometimes in the morning after a graveyard shift. Now the staff on Craig Rd acts like they do not want to be there and can be rude at times. It's not just me but I hear this around the area from others. I have since moved near the Centennial location and had the same experience. During my first visits I loved the place, staff and people were great. Now that management has changed a couple of times the place has gone downhill. I can really tell the difference since Bobbi was the manager here and now. Staff is slow and appears to be there just to collect a pay check; no one has a welcoming attitude. Yes they greet you when come in but it feels like they are greeting because that is the rule. My first sign of the decline was when I waited 40 minutes for an order of wings from the bar. I showed a manager the time stamp on my order receipt and all I got was a, \\\"oh okay,  I'm sorry\\\" and he walked away. As of this past Thursday (July 9, 20130) I have decided to stop coming here. I ordered six wings, spinach dip, two beers and two scotches. I noticed on the other side of the bar a customer complaining to the manager and the bar tender making a drink near me with an attitude saying, \\\"whatever\\\" and other employees coming in the bar area trying to see what was going on. That was really nothing compared to a couple of hours after I got home. My stomach was cramping all night and the next morning and I was running to take a crap every hour or two through the night.

Place was mostly cleared out, I'd say that about 60% of the restaurant was completely open.\\n\\nI sat down with my girlfriend, waiter shows up to get our order, we get some appetizers, cheese sticks to start off with.     Now me and my girlfriend are sitting watching the game, the cheese sticks arrive, they're pretty good, and everything is cool.\\n\\n  Then the waiter comes back within about a minute of bringing the cheese sticks and asks if we're ready to order, we shake our heads as we haven't even finished eating the cheese sticks.\\n\\nWithin another minute, he's back again, so we just go ahead and order our entrees and everything is cool, the waiter vanishes, and we're back to watching the football game.\\n\\n\\nWe get our entrees, I ordered a Big Jack Daddy burger, normally delicious but somewhat off, the pulled pork was cold, the burger was dry and had barely any BBQ sauce on it so I asked the waiter for some.  My girlfriend's biting into her chicken tenders which also were somewhat under-par.      The waiter comes back with the BBQ sauce, then disappears again, we're watching the football game and within a few minutes, he's back, asking if we want desert.................um, while I'm not even halfway done with my entree.       We say no, go back to our food and at this point, some Buffalo Wild Wings honcho, maybe a manager stops by our table and asks how things are, I say alright although privately I'm starting to feel a bit crowded.\\n\\n  Then as I'm just finishing my entree, the waiter comes by, swoops the plate and takes off.    Next thing I know he's coming to the table, shoving the check next to me and saying he can \\\"get it whenever we're ready\\\", which at this point I feel like I'm getting the bum's rush and I look around the restaurant and realize that its even emptier than we got there.       I made a point of asking him if maybe they were closing early or something and he got defensive and walked off.    \\n\\n  At that point, I didn't see him the rest of the night, but I did notice on the bill that he had the audacity to charge us for the extra BBQ sauce I asked for to cover up the dryness of the overcooked burger and the fact that they barely put any sauce on it to begin with.    \\n\\n\\n The fact I was being charged for BBQ sauce in a place that serves it up en masse was ridiculous.     What's next?   Fork and knife rental fees?   First time I've been charged for that at any restaurant, and especially at Buffalo Wild Wings.        Putting that on top of the lousy, pushy service was enough for me to leave the lowest tip I've left at any restaurant.         \\n\\n\\n   I'd understand on a busy night about table turnover but sitting back on a nearly completely dead evening, we're one of a few handful of tables actually filled in the waiter's section, watching a football game while ordering food and getting basically tossed out.     No thanks, there's many other places where I can get decent food without being treated like the waiter is doing me a favor and not the other way around.  \\n\\n\\nI'll try the Buffalo Wild Wings location out at Norterra but this whole experience was pretty much a bust for me, cold food, dry burger, lousy service and on top of that, getting nickel and dimed on the BBQ sauce.

I read the other yelp reviews before heading in but I had also gotten massages by blind people in China, which were awesome, so I went in with an open mind.  She was nice and had a good energy but her technique was not refined.  Her strokes were short and clumsy and I don't think she even has a massage license (I didn't have the heart to ask).  She tried getting the pressure points, but missed, she didn't really know how to get rid of my huge shoulder knot and I kind of just wanted the massage to be over.  She was quick on each of the body parts and she had this kind of timer device that she checked periodically and when she realized that there's still plenty of time left, she would find a body part to massage.  It was like child's play massage.  When I left the room, her husband wasn't sitting out in the waiting area like another yelper had mentioned before, but he was in the salon because I heard him later on.\\n\\nSo there was some mix up with my appointment because instead of getting a facial right after my massage, I was taken in for my pedicure.  The lady, Tanya was a little off.  She didn't have me pick out my nail color first, and she had me soaking in the water too long because she had to finish up with someone else.  My feet were so pruney that I think she cut my skin while cutting my nails but it's hard for me to tell.  She didn't ask how I liked my nails cut and made them round when I like them square.  Her painting job was amateur to say the least, there's paint all over my cuticles and skin.  She was nice but I'm paying for a service to be done properly.  My paint job was better than this one, I'm really tempted to just remove the color so I can re-do it myself.  Tanya was also talking to me for so long that she didn't watch the time and we were going over.\\n\\nJulie then took me in for my facial and she was very polite and professional - she apologized for the mix-up, the regular receptionist is away getting married or something, so hence the confusion.  She also apologized for Tanya and also for her daughter that had come to hang out at the salon.  Julie's facial was good, she put me to sleep at one point, so that's a good sign.\\n\\nI like small businesses because 90% of businesses are small businesses, however, I don't like small businesses that doesn't focus on the customer - because, hello, that's who's paying the bills!  \\nGotta cater to the customers so they will come back.", "beginning": "My sister purchased a livingsocial voucher for me as a", "mgt": "\"My sister purchased a livingsocial voucher for me as a birthday gift, and I couldn't have been more thrilled.

My friends and I try to be somewhat responsible and book a nearby hotel and use a taxi service to get to the concert. When the concert is over, just walk to the QuikTrip on the corner right outside of Ak-Chin and catch a cab back to the hotel. It saves us the headache of trying to navigate our way out of the lot which can take a good hour. \\n\\nAk Chin puts on a great show with fantastic sound and great projection screens. We  paid for actual seats in a section for Blake Shelton but quickly realized the better way to go is with lawn seats. Lawn seats were my first choice but someone in my party wanted to be closer. When I'm at a concert, I'm pretty much dancing and singing as are all the people on the lawn. Not everyone in my section felt the music in the same fashion and stayed seated for most of the show so my girls and I got a few looks but truth be told, I paid the same amount of money as they did and if I want to show my enthusiasm by standing and dancing, I'm gonna do it. But from now on, I'll stick with the lawn. It's a better crowd anyway.\\n\\nDrink prices are no more than any other concert venue and there are plenty of choices, even a tequila bar. Better food would be nice though. A hard pretzel for $3.50 and cheese sauce for an additional $4 is a little steep. I'd pay quite a bit more to have a decent meal from a local restaurant down in the food and drink area. \\n\\nMisters cool the crowd down in the food and drink area which is very welcome because it gets HOT jamming out in the middle of summer!", "beginning": "I have a ball every time I go to Ak-Chin", "mgt": "\"I have a ball every time I go to Ak-Chin.

We brought it to the attention of the staff. Unbelieveable that they truly believed it was how it was supposed to look. I've had more than my fair share over the years and have never come across such stupidity. How can you serve sashimi to people that has been cooked and is obviously not RAW? So the guy took it back and brought out another serving of the same exact thing. Same conversation again. I finally had him take it back and got the tuna instead which I didn't want but was ok. I can't walk into the place again knowing that their sushi chef can't tell the difference... it's embarrassing for them. Even before the food was served my three year old knocked over a small cup of water.

I really appreciated our waitress' attentiveness and outstanding service.\\n\\nSecond, the inside dining area was beautiful and quiet.  It had an outstanding atmosphere for conversation.  The place was incredibly clean, spacious and chique.

The bread served to us at the beginning was crisp outside and soft delicious inside.  \\n\\nWhat did I order? I cannot remember (let alone pronounce) the fancy Italian words so bear with me as I describe the items I ordered. The appetizer was a flatbread which was almost the size of an A4 paper covered with toppings and lots lots lots of delicious cheese.  The main consisted of spinach, grilled chicken and potatoes. The spicy sauce was really the superstar of that plate.  It was too bad that I ran out of sauce halfway though my chicken. Next time, more sauce please!  And, finally, for my dessert, I ordered the tiramisu - a large square-shaped decadent light fluffy cake with layers of rich creamy coffee filling.  \\n\\nIf there's anything to improve, I'd say the portions have to be smaller.  Strange how my feedback contradicts the complaint from a previous reviewer saying the portions were too small?

Unfortunately, I only have that one experience upon which to base my assessment of Pyarr. \\n\\nLocated in Village Square, just a few doors down from the Regal Cinemas, Pyarr is relatively new, and its obvious it hasn't built up its clientele yet. I visited during the lunch buffet with a friend one weekday, and we were the only other people dining in there aside from one guy at his lonely table. Seating was open, but we were promptly greeted and quickly brought water as our drink orders were being taken, which left us to hit up the buffet.\\n\\nOf course, this is where my review gets highly subjective. The buffet selection was, let's say, not impressive. Especially not if you're a vegetarian (hello!). There were only eight-to-10 hot plates from which to choose, and none of these were fried goodies such as samosa, pakora or papadum. The selection does change daily, but I'd rather see Pyarr ixnay the bulk of its mostly ignored cold condiment selections to make room for more hot stuff. And maybe they will when business picks up.\\n\\nThe buffet does include a serving of their fresh naan, however, and I will say this: I think this is the best naan I've had in Vegas, even counting my beloved India Palace. And even though the selection was weak, the food I did have (jeera rice, aloo palak, yellow daal) was tasty and just spicy enough.\\n\\nThe service was excellent. We were being checked up on regularly, asked for feedback on specific dishes, re-filled with beverages (maybe not accurately, but ...), etc. Again, this might have been because we were the only people in the joint, but hey, it's something.\\n\\nEither way, I plan to come back to explore the menu further during dinner hours, so I can maybe give a more well-rounded review.", "beginning": "It's really not fair to rate an Indian restaurant based", "mgt": "\"It's really not fair to rate an Indian restaurant based solely on its ambiance.

So when you tell me there is a new salad on the menu each day, I envision someone at a Chinese restaurant saying we are offering a different style of pizza today. That's a not a good thing. If the guy is listening to Pink Floyd, that means the dial is moving even further away on the authentic meter. What's next, are they going to start offerring hooka and child's chicken finger and fries plate?\\nDon't get me wrong, Dhaba is one of the few Indian restaurants in Phoenix that I will actually dine at since most are terrible and that's not me being critical. Phoenix is a great place for bad Indian restaurants to thirve since the population is clueless when it comes to Indian food and you could seriously serve up some ground beef with curry and give it a name and they would think it's a legitimate and authentic dish...and this goes for the white dudes living in London who comes on these forums and tells us they know great Indian food when they give places like India Gate 5 stars....but I digress. Okay so if you are not an Indian food snob and want to break out of your routine of eating at Black Angus, this is a good place to start. If you have eaten great Indian food and are not easily mesmerized by a nice atmosphere go down McClintock and take a left on Broadway and try Royal Taj", "beginning": "I walked into this place thinking: \\\"Oh man, you know", "mgt": "I walked into this place thinking: \"Oh man, you know this is going to be just another average café.\" However, I was pleasantly surprised.

I started in one waiting area where I signed in and waited to be called up for paper work.  When I was called up I was moved to a second waiting room where I completed my paper work and waited to be called up again.  I was called up after a few minutes and processed in their computer system.  I sat back down and waited until I was called into yet another waiting room.  Waiting room #3.  I sat there for several minutes before I was brought a clip board with more paper work and two hospital gowns to change into.  I changed and completed my paperwork and watched several other people get called in before me.  I'm pretty sure some of them got there after me but I can look past that.  I did take some valium to get me through the scan so maybe they were waiting for it to take affect.  When I finally got called back to the MRI I climbed up on the table, put my head in a cage that made me feel not unlike Hannibal Lecter, and was slowly inserted into the tube.  It only lasted 15 minutes.  I was expecting to be in there a lot longer. I didn't even need the valium with how short a time I was in.  Whatever.  At least I made it through.  Steinberg may have a machine that I consider superior to the one West Valley but they herd you like cattle from one room to the next.

{"trgt": "Definitely one of my best dining experiences in Vegas so far, which isn't saying much, since I've only had buffets). We had tickets for a show at 8pm, and ended up bumping up our reservation last minute to 530pm (when the restaurant opens) without a hitch.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is definitely very trendy -- black lacquer countertops, red roses, clear hurricanes of colorful peppers, fruit & red roses around an open kitchen -- and despite the business casual recommendation, there were many people in jeans and tshirts as well. \\n\\nAtmosphere/ service: The countertop seating gives you the best view of the kitchen, and feels like a sushi bar. The waiters are definitely attentive, probably bc they can't escape you looking at them when your'e done eating.\\n\\nFOOD\\nMenu: There's a tasting menu, a smaller 5 course menu, tapas (about $20/ plate, NOT recommended), and traditional appetizers + main course menu. And also a theatre menu (L'Unique) with 3 courses all on one plate for $39, served in 15 min. We ordered the club menu, plus a tapas, appetizer, and dessert a la carte-- more than enough for 2 people. We enjoyed a half bottle of sparkling rose ($50, light and fruity but not recommended-- gave us headaches afterwards). \\n\\nOverall, the portions weren't huge but it was definitely very rich-- either with butter, cream, or heavily doused in olive oil. Such is French cooking, eh? (Actually, it was more Californian style than French, with the exception of a heavy hand in cream, butter, and olive oil in every dish.)\\n\\nBreaking it down: (updated from website; it's not posted there yet)\\n1. Amuse bouche: foie gras, port wine reduction, and parmesan foam parfait. Salty, foamy, and well balanced, savorly bite to start the evening. Best dish of the evening.\\n2. Mussels in a chowder: very creamy, also very savory and o\\n3. Langosteen dumping with arugula/ spring salad - tasted like shrimp tempura, but the lobster was very tender; the salad was a pass\\n4. Pounded veal - just OK\\n5. Trio of goat, cow's,  and cow's cheeses (in order of robust to mild) served with walnut-raisin bread (best to eat on its own, or with a mild cheese), egg-walnut bread, and country bread (best with goat cheese). Cheeses were fresh, imported from France. \\n6. Five traditional tarts slices - chocolate (just OK), white chocolate with lemon sauce, pineapple filling & earl gray toasted rice crispies (the best of the 5), chocolate cinnamon ganache (deceivingly rich), raspberry (fresh and light), and Snickers (very rich, although an actual Snickers bar isn't hard to recreate :-P)\\n7. Anchovy, red bell pepper, and eggplant  confit - must eat all ingredients together for proper seasonings and savoriness. Without the anchovies, the entire dish is bland and oily. Ample servings to share. I had to eat it with bread to balance out the oil.\\n8. Seasonal vegetable salad - wayyyy too much olive oil; even after eating, we had 3 tbsp left of oil on the bottom of the plate. Seasonal vegetables = olives, endives, butter lettuce, and avocado. Definitely not to be ordered again!\\n9. Sorbets and ice creams - refreshing ending. 5 scoops of mandarin orange sorbet (favorite), vanilla bean, coffee (both mediocre), raspberry sorbet (light), and pistachio ice cream (second favorite) topped with sugar crisp and 2 pieces of thin chocolate.\\n\\nOther information:\\n- Our waiter informed us all the food was shipped directly from France, including the cheese. \\n- Joel Robuchon makes his own bread (complimentary, bottomless bread basket with mini baguettes, country bread rolls, and buttery plain crossaints) bc \\\"he couldn't find a good bakery in Vegas.\\\"\\n- Still water costs $8 (Evian).\\n- Reservations recommended, need to confirm 72 hrs in advance to secure\\n- NOT for vegetarians or vegans - every dish has seafood or meat except the bread. \\n- If you're allergic to shellfish, tell the restaurant in advance and they have some menu alternatives.\\n\\nOverall, 4.5 stars (rounded up to 5).

{"trgt": "My wife and I were excited to try this place as the menu looked good and they offered an $80 groupon which helps \\\"offset\\\" the tourist pricing of these types of places (we are Las Vegas residents).  The staff was nice and attentive, and if based solely on them this would be a solid 4 star review.  The food, however was very average at best and  very expensive for what it was.  We started with a $16 chop salad that was VERY SMALL and very average, especially for the price.  It never ceases to amaze me how some high end places skimp on stuff like this that costs them mere pennies (iceberg lettuce and a few other cheap ingredients) and would definitely add more value to an expensive meal without much more expense on their part.  The bread was very crappy and either stale or lightly toasted, not sure which one.  Any italian place, especially high end ones should really focus on having quality bread as this is an italian staple.  The entrees came out, my chicken picatta was OK flavorwise, but it was NOT a chicken breast (first time I have had that happen anywhere) but rather a thigh.  About 5 bites of chicken and that was it.  My wife's lobster ravioli was a much larger portion and was pretty good overall, the one bright spot in the meal (although still a $36 entree).  Three glasses of lower end wine and we were already well over $100 for a relatively small quantity of average food.  Honestly, the Olive Garden is much better than this place.

{"trgt": "Hidden away among the slowly decaying businesses of Lake Las Vegas and far, far away from any parking, the Auld Dubliner is still one of the best Irish pubs in town.  Pretty much because the bar understands that a pub should be low key and classic.  In Ireland, a pub is just a run of the mill watering hole.  But by the time they migrate over to the states, many of them become extravagant or showy places in an attempt to seem more European.  \\n\\nNot the Auld Dubliner.  The place is classic.  While the establishment is fairly new, it feels like a place where the wood on the bar has been worn down from a hundred years of spilled beer.  The bar's selection of Irish whiskeys is solid.  Not the widest selection in town, but a long enough collection that it will take you awhile to drink through the menu.  On top of that, the place has a superb beer selection.  One of my favorite Irish beers (Kilkenny) is almost impossible to find in the western U.S. and they have it on tap.  If for no other reason, the bar is praiseworthy for its well chosen stock of spirits and beer.   \\n\\nBut they also serve up a solid pub menu.  When we went, we had deep fried chips with curry (yum) and a couple of solid cheese burgers topped with Irish cheddar cheese.  The night we were there they had a solo guitar act playing and he did a pretty solid job with a library of Irish rock and soul ballads.\\n\\nI hope that Lake Las Vegas figures out how to survive because the Auld Dubliner is a fine place to bring a group for drinks.", "beginning": "Hidden away among the slowly decaying businesses of Lake Las", "mgt": "\"Hidden away among the slowly decaying businesses of Lake Las, this quaint little café offers a surprising escape from the mundane.

{"trgt": "I remember in elementary school I had a friend of mine who regaled me with wild stories of how excellent the buffet was at the Rio. Flash forward some 20 years later, and we're visiting a friend from Vegas who can't wait to take my girlfriend and I to this place. SURE! I sez.\\n\\nWhat I found was that the Rio buffet was like every other buffet I've ever been at in my life. There's a lot of food, but there's a lot of mediocre food. There's an Asian section that tastes like every take-out place you've ever had, with greasy duck, glaze-saturated pork, dry satay chicken skewers, and sushi with tough seaweed. There's a meat section with cut sirloin steak with absolutely inedible gristle adding annoyance, not flavor. There's a seafood station, which beyond the unlimited crab legs, is filled with fried foods, not fresh foods.\\n\\nA few positives: great pie, good ham, half-decent Chinese siu mai.\\n\\nWe got in for about half the usual price ($16 as opposed to somewhere in the neighborhood of $32). Even at fire-sale prices, it still wasn't enough to get me to go back. Maybe this was a three-star place, but after hearing so many people in my life talk up the magic and wizardry of Vegas buffets, I was left especially disappointed.\\n\\nSo, here's my advice: is a buffet a personal challenge to you to stuff your face with four plates of food, or do you want to just have a decent dinner? I'm the second kind of person, so next time I'd recommend to do as I do, and put that $30 towards one of the many, many, many exceptional restaurants on the strip that are competing on the basis of quality, not quantity.

Definitely a must try. \\n\\nMy sister got the Machacha Plate which came with beans, rice, and warm tortillas. The machacha itself was pretty bland, nothing really lively or exciting about it.

{"trgt": "Eh, maybe I'm a tough critic but this place met my standards for a DECENT Ramen joint. I've eaten a lot of Ramen from Las Vegas to So-cal and Nor-cal. I've even attempted Man vs Food's challenge at Orochan Ramen (Little Tokyo's) Spiciest & biggest Ramen bowl. So I know my Ramen, and this place was A-OK but I've tried better. \\n\\nRamen Noodle:4/5 I liked the noodles, it was a bit thicker and chewier than most Ramen joints I've tried but I didn't like how chewy it was. Thicker was a plus but chewy no. \\n\\nBroth Spicy Miso: 3/5 I ordered the SPICY MISO RAMEN which was actually not spicy at all. Even though the soup turned red after mixing it a bit, but don't let looks fool you. The broth was a bit greasy you could see the oil bubbles this was definitely a turn off. The broth was very light, I felt like the broth was missing something. \\n\\nBroth Chashu Miso: 2/5 The broth was very light and oily. Once again I felt like it was missing something, NOT ENOUGH FLAVOR. I barely tasted the Miso and everyone knows Miso is salty which made the soup not as salty as most soups I've tried.\\n\\nChashu: 2/5 The Chashu pork, if you know what Chashu pork is its really Pork belly. That's simmered for about an hour slow cooking so its soft tasty and chewy. The pork belly they used was more pork less fat which was okay but everyone knows the flavor is in the fat. The Chashu pork was a bit chewier than most I've tried but also remember it was more meat than fat. My order came with one slice so I ordered extra Chashu because I love chashu pork, but I'm not a fan of theirs. \\n\\nTamago (egg) : 0/5 REMEMBER! The order does not come with a Tamago, even if on the menu there's a picture of one. I guess I assumed on the menu the picture was exactly what I was ordering. I usually like 2 tamago's so I ordered 1 extra. Not knowing I was ordering just HALF of an egg. So When I got my miso ramen I was sad to see I only had 1 half of a tamago. THE TAMAGO was TASTELESS! No flavor at all. A real tamago is kepted over night in a soy sauce based sweet sauce. But this was NOT A TAMAGO. The Tamago WASN'T EVEN BROWN! The Tamago is my favorite part of my ramen and they totally ruined it.\\n\\nAlcohol: 0/5 Currently they don't have their liquor license which makes it such a tease on the menu because who doesn't love to enjoy a Sapporo beer with their Ramen. Instead I was forced to enjoy my Ramen with a glass of water imprinted with the Sapporo sticker (even more of a tease)\\n\\nService: 2/5 The waitress and the waiter were super nice but not so much the manager. My boyfriend eats a lot, so he ordered a large which was suppose to have more noodles and more soup but it wasn't enough for him. So we asked and offered to pay for more noodles since he still had a lot of soup left but they said no we would have to buy a whole new bowl which was a big disappointment because at MONTA my boyfriend always orders more noodles with no problem \\n \\nParking: 5/5 The place was dead, when I pulled in there had to be 2 other cars there. They have a small back parking lot which is a plus. \\n\\nWait: 5/5 THERE IS NO WAIT! Which was awesome because I was hungry when I got there. I was seated quickly", "beginning": "Eh, maybe I'm a tough critic but this place met", "mgt": "\"Eh, maybe I'm a tough critic but this place met my expectations only halfway.

If you haven't been, parking in the front is nearly non - existent.\\nWe ordered the Reina Pepiada, which is a featured review item and wood fired chicken arepas, plus an order of Yucca fries.\\nIn seeing the photos of the Reina Pepiada, I expected the sauce to be a light, creamy cilantro avocado type of dressing. What I actually experienced was very heavy and overly sauced chicken. With each bite, I kept thinking how the addition of a nice fresh slaw could cut some of that richness. The tortas were also heavy and chewy and again my expectations of a light, fluffy flatbread were dashed. I did like the peas, though. They provided additional sauces, which was unnecessary considering the meat was already drowning in it. The yucca fries were nothing special.  My daugter seemed to enjoy her wood fired chicken arepa. The Reina Pepiada didn't sit well with my wife as she was sick the rest of the night.\\nViva Las Arepas fell short of what I wanted to experience. I so wanted to love this place, but didn't.

A couple minutes later, they come out warm packets of chewey bagel goodness.  I especially recommend it for bagel sandwiches involving cheese. \\n\\nI ordered the Italian bagel sandwich -- a combination of ham, pepperoni, provelone and banana peppers on an onion bagel.  I subbed a plain bagel, since I hate onions, and the server was totally cool with the substitution.  After steaming, the bagel came out a cheesey warm chewey delight.  Think toasted Quiznos, but with better ingredients.\\n\\nThe wide range of menu items can be a little overwhelming if you're looking at the variety of posters suspended from the ceiling.  Your better bet is to grab a printed menu from the counter.\\n\\nPerhaps the only thing better than a steamed bagel from this shop is a steamed cookie.  The cookies are generously sized and delicious as-is.

We both ordered our steaks medium rare . . . . well, they didn't come out that way . . . they were more medium to medium well and the cooking was very inconsistent.\\n\\nWe both think it has to do with the cooking process . . . they boast that they cook the steaks at 1000 degrees and then bring them to your table on a plate that is 500 degrees.  But what happens is that the steak continues to cook on the plate so that when it arrives . . . it is medium well on the outside . . . and continues to get more done the longer it is on the plate.\\n\\nAnd what's with all the butter on the steak?  Both steaks were covered in butter and it pooled on the plate. . . .both steaks were a bit salty as well. . . . . the cut of meat seemed good . . . it didn't need all that butter and salt on it.\\n\\nThe sides are extra at $10 each . . . the baked potato was good and the creamed spinach was excellent.\\n\\nAs for the deserts . . . . the chocolate cake was excellent and the creme brulee was good.\\n\\nIn summary, we won't be going back to RC anytime soon as there are several steak houses that a much better and actually more reasonable . . . . to give just a few examples, I would rather go to Carve at Eastside Cannery; Fuego at the Fiesta; Hanks at GV Ranch; or one of my favs Hugo's Cellar on Fremont Street.\\n\\nLastly, before RC, this restaurant was called The Range.

{"trgt": "I pass through Charlotte at least a couple times per year, typically around the holidays, and usually meet up with friends to grab a bite to eat.  Tonight, we ended up in Plaza Midwood (a small neighborhood with trendy eateries) at Dish.  Dish is a casual Southern restaurant with a laid back atmosphere, friendly staff, and reasonably priced food.\\n\\nThe restaurant has a bit of an old school Southern feel to it with its small wooden tables and chairs, vinyl tablecloths, and retro signage and decor.  The menu features Southern staples such as chicken and dumplings, meatloaf, shrimp and grits, and a pot roast.  They also serve Mexican items (burritos and quesadillas) and sandwiches.\\n\\nI was drawn to their BBQ sliders appetizer because it included three sliders with a choice of three sauces: eastern NC (vinegar based), SC (mustard based), and \\\"Chicago\\\" (sweet tomato based).  I asked for one slider with each sauce.  Each slider had pulled pork with the sauce poured on top, inside of a biscuit with a pickle on top.  The plate was served with a small sample of Carolina-style cole slaw (vinegar, no mayo).  There was not as much meat as I hoped and while the biscuits were good, there was too high of a bread-to-meat ratio for my liking.\\n\\nLike other Southern restaurants, Dish offers vegetable plates.  Each vegetable plate comes with a biscuit, glazed on top with honey, and a deviled egg.  I tried the mac and cheese, squash casserole, and mashed sweet potatoes.  The noodles in the mac and cheese were your typical small sized mac and cheese noodles (like you make at home).  Good texture and not too oily.  Squash casserole tasted homemade (in a good way).  Not a huge fan of the mashed sweet potatoes, but you could tell they were freshly mashed sweet potatoes and not processed.  Check out my photos to see the food.\\n\\nOur server was Mollie and she provided good service.  The food came out fast.  The restaurant has a bar in the back and also has a bunch of unique paintings.  Not sure if they are for sale, but they were interesting to look at.

As mentioned by many other reviewers, Lotus of Siam is located in a sketchy-looking strip mall off of Sahara.  Unlike some others, though, we thankfully avoided being accosted by panhandlers likely because it was midday in July and we cabbed over from the Hard Rock (approx. $20 ride with tip), which let us off right at the front door.

The complex m\\u00e9lange of crispy rice, minced pork, green onions, fresh chilis, ginger, peanuts and lime juice was as tasty as it's been described by countless Yelpers.  Next, we had the Kang Ka Noon, a northern style curry made with young jack fruit chunks, with pork.  Not being familiar with northern Thai cuisine and jack fruit, we took a leap of faith on this dish.  Our faith was rewarded with deliciousness, although it was definitely less spicy or \\\"curry-like\\\" than our preconceived notions of a Thai curry dish.  Finally, we had the Sea Bass on Drunken Noodle.  The sea bass was delicately deep fried, then topped with a fresh chili and Thai basil sauce and served over pan fried, flat rice noodles.  The fish was moist.  The sauce was spicy and flavorful.  The noodles were perfectly pan fried, still tender, without dryness or rubberiness.  \\n\\nLotus of Siam may be overhyped, but damn if it wasn't the best Thai food I can ever recall having!

{"trgt": "With all of the talk about this place we had to go here while visiting Edinburgh from the US. As such, considering the pedestal this place has been put on, I've taken a different approach to grading The Witchery. I call it the \\\"benefit-of-the-doubt' rating system. Goes like this...I gave it 5 stars before I even sat down. Then, took away and added stars as the meal progressed. So, the stars were their's to lose. \\n\\nWent there for lunch....results:\\n\\nAmbience - Excellent. Let me just say that this place is spectacular.....out a movie set or fiction novel. But, it's very real and in a beautiful 16th century historic building. A very cool and other-worldly ambience. We sat in the Secret Garden area downstairs...loved it....no stars lost. \\n\\nService - Fair. Attentive when they were around. But, too slow for me. Big delay between apps and main course even though we were the 2nd table seated. Overall, took 2 hours for lunch and we were never offered anything else to drink after our initial drink orders...not even water....had to ask for everything...1 star lost.\\n\\nDrinks - Excellent. Judy had a Pimm's, wife had a glass of sauv blanc and I had a Hendrick's Martini with a cuke garnish. Plus, after-lunch cappuccino's were excellent...1 star awarded (they're back to 5 stars!).\\n\\nApps - Underwhelmed. A selection of bread and butter was served. Bread seemed day-old and cold but tasted OK. I prefer warm bread. Wife had oysters on the half shell and they were reported to be good. I had a seafood bisque and it was presented nicely in an iron pot with crostini (croutons) and parmesan and rouille on the side. But, it was a vey thin soup that didn't have a distinct flavor....I'm sure it was a lot of work but it just tasted like some basic fish stock. I usually think of a bisque as being thicker and richer but this may just be a cultural thing. It was neither good nor bad....1 star lost.\\n\\nMain Course - This one is tricky. Kids split the roasted chicken with fondant potato and green beans and chips on the side. My wife and Judy got the roasted, hot-smoked salmon with sweet potatoes and green beans. My mother-in-law Mary and I both got Guy Grieve's scallops w/ pancetta and whipped potatoes. Here's the rundown...kids' chicken had good flavor but was very dry....seemed like it may have sat for a while. Their chips were very good, though. The salmon was reported from wife and Judy as being simple but very good. Seems like it had a lemon/butter-based sauce with it and served with green beans. They really liked the dish. Everything about the scallop dish was mediocre. Whipped potatoes were cold (ok, luke warm), scallops were over cooked or had been sitting under a salamander for too long. Pancetta was hard and chewy. Salad was not memorable....1 star lost.\\n\\nSo, it was an OK experience in the end. My wife and Judy enjoyed their meals. Mary and I didn't. All agreed the service was not the best.

{"trgt": "In a market that is known for it's golf this course leaves a lot to be desired. My wife and I are avid golfers and we love to take advantage of Groupon deals for golf in the area. We purchased this Groupon for $50. This gave us a day of golf, cart, range balls and lunch. So let's start with the range. Keeping in mind that the range is not the most important thing about a golf course, it still does matter. The range had NO grass besides where you were hitting from. It was like hitting balls into the abyss. After we finish up there we move on to the 1st hole which is across the street and down a sidewalk. You would expect signs leading you to the first hole but there was not. Fortunately the guy in the pro shop was aware and came out to tell us as he saw us asking others where to find the first hole. Now to the course itself. This course was in horrible condition. I understand that we overseed during certain times of the year here but never have I played a course during this time that was in this poor of condition. First off, there is dirt everywhere around this course. The sand traps were hard as a rock, it was almost like hitting out of cement when we landed there. But viewing them, it looked like an old dried up river. While on the course it was so loud! Keep in mind we played on a Sunday, yet they had guys out there seeding??? On a Sunday? Really? Back to the noise factor...I understand they can't control the residents that live on the course but some trees might help filter out the noise and keep kids from throwing water bottles onto the golf course. This happened on the 2nd hole while we were playing. In the middle of swinging, all of the sudden there is a water bottle plowing into the fairway. Nice...\\nOver all the course was just awful. The worst I have played in the valley. From the huge dirt patches throughout, to the dead sod all around that has been neglected to the dried up lake beds for sand traps, it just doesn't add up.\\nWhen you decide to put your golf course on Groupon and try to get business I would hope that you would make sure your course is in WAY better condition. We will not be going back. It's unfortunate because the course has potential. The buildings are updated, and the infrastructure is nice. Heck the bathroom on the course was one of the nicest.

I told him I am not familiar with the hotel can he show me where to go. He pointed into the casino floor, never even looked up. I told him I couldnt believe after being stolen from in their hotel that he was not more willing to assist me in which he replied \\\" look lady if I had a charger in this drawer id give it to you, but i dont. Itd not my fault you cant charge your phone.\\\" WOW you would think he could have at least walked me over to security to try to help me. \\n\\nI eventually found the security station.

I ended up having to buy a $45 charger from the gift shop. \\n\\nOn top of that when I went back to my room to get into bed the sheets had chocolate stains all over. I called the front desk who told me they could have a sheet change done in 90 mins. I told her I could not wait that long as I needed to get some rest and had a big day the next day is there any one who could come sooner. She replied that they have limited house keeping and I shouldnt expect so much, there isnt anything I can do. WOW! \\n\\nThe next day my husband came to join me, when he arrived he came to the valet. The valet told him the lot was full and he couldnt not park. I was on the phone with him walking to greet him- my husband said I am a guest here is there another place I can park myself. The valet said no this is your only option, but if you give me $100 I'll work it out for you. I told my husband do not give him any money I will be right there with a manager.

{"trgt": "COLORED ONLY: Sat in what felt like the minority section of the patio which was the secluded darkened desolate corner area.

{"trgt": "I wish that I could rate this place zero stars or negative stars.  \\n\\nHere are just a few things that I did not like: \\n\\n1) Room's cleanliness: Room was very dirty. I found a Revlon makeup container in the bedroom floor. So, it was evident that the housekeepers didn't vacuum. I am a male and I don't use makeup. My wife doesn't use Revlon, so I know it wasn't something that fell out of my suitcase. \\n\\nThe bathroom was, in their own manager's words, \\\"disgusting.\\\"  I found lots of hair on the bathroom floor (obviously, no one even attempted to clean this). I also found pubic hairs on the tub and sink.  Let's just sat that I shave and there is no chance that the body hair of any kind was mine.  Several \\\"clean\\\" towels had hairs on them, and the hairs were from different people (hairs were red, blond, black, brown, etc.). \\n\\nUntil this trip, I had never complained at a hotel ever in my entire life. I used to clean bathrooms and gyms as a college student, so I know how tough it is to get the job done in the time allotted. Also, I am a very forgiving person. I don't expect my room to be as clean as an operating room. On Saturday morning, I went to the manager and complained. He listened to me, and expressed his apologies. He also said that the hair in the floor was \\\"disgusting\\\" and \\\"unacceptable.\\\" He offered me a free buffet ticket.  That's it.  A free buffet ticket...wait for it...for two people.  He basically accused me of lying. \\n\\nI got the sense that the manager thought I had invited some women into my room because he asked me several times if I was alone (and, I was). I suppose the issue was that I didn't complain shortly after checking in. Well, I basically fell asleep as soon as I got to my room on Friday night and I didn't wake up until Saturday morning. I complained as soon as I noticed the hair. \\n\\nLesson learned: check your room ASAP after entering and report any dissatisfactory conditions immediately. \\n\\nThe housekeeping manager came to my room later on Saturday and checked on my room. That was a nice gesture and made me feel like they actually cared a little. \\n\\n2) Check-in Process: I arrived around 4:00 PM on a Friday. The line to check in was very long, and it took about 30 minutes to get to the desk to check in. \\n\\n3) Ambiance: There were a lot of people in the hotel promoting various dinner specials, show specials, etc. I don't want to deal with that inside my hotel. The Strip is one thing, but come on: I don't want chaos inside my hotel. I go inside to get some peace. The hotel's crowd included a lot of country-Western \\\"macho\\\" guys, which I can't tolerate being around. I also prefer to be around a little bit higher class of person than was at Treasure Island. I don't like being threatened at a bar for accidentally bumping into someone who was blocking the only walking path in Gilley's bar. \\n\\n4) Wi-fi internet not free: It's a little ridiculous that hotels charge for wi-fi.

I ask him if he HAD the address, why was he insistent that I give him what he already knows... He said, \\\"you know what?! We're not delivering to you as you are outside our delivery area!\\\". I was in the process of speaking when he intrupided me to tell me this. I had found another address for the hospital and was trying to give that one to him. He continuely over spoke me...

My boyfriend and I sat at the bar near the front patio, we tried to order a few of the margaritas and the bartender told us she didn't have the ingredients to make those.  We asked what she could make us, she said 'pretty much just a regular margarita.'  The main bar is about 10 steps away, I was thinking she would at least either get ingredients from them to make the drinks, or have them make it and she would bring it over.  After going with the regular margaritas the bartender had the ingredients for, we finished and wanted to ordered a bottled beer.

I got to order drinks and after they were made they were very good.  We finished the first drinks and my bf ordered another of the same drink, this time his drink tasted NOTHING like the previous one, it was kind of gross like it was missing a main ingredient.  After he paid for that drink, a few minutes later he noticed he didn't get his card back so he told the bartender.  The bartender asked for his last name as if he was going to look for the card and instead proceeded to go to the next customer and take a drink order ...I waited after he made the new customer their drink, to see if he would look for the card, he didn't he just proceeded to make more drinks.  We flagged down another bartender who made the awful drink to look behind the bar for the card, she did a real swift look and didn't come back to tell us if she found or didn't find the card. INSTEAD, she proceeded to take her purse and leave the bar,i guess to go on her break. WOW! We had planned to go to dinner afterwards and my bf was going to buy.  Turns out he couldn't buy or go to dinner if he didn't have his card.  So I went to the hostess this time, she took down all my information and i asked her to go look behind the bar.  I told her I know its there and we need to go to dinner but can't without my boyfriends card.  She seemed sincere and i watched her go up to the first bartender we tried to get help from.

Really?!?  You're coming over to tell us how long we have been waiting???  It was so rude and disrespectful, she was trying to argue her point to us which clearly showed that the server did not put in our order immediately which is probably why the server apologized to us umpteen times!!!  It was the most ridiculous display of what NOT to do as a manager.  I have been in management and customer service for over 12 years and this was clearly a Management 101 mistake.  She never apologized or tried to rectify the situation, but when you come out to your customers in fighting mode you really cannot rectify that! \\n\\n Needless to say, unless this restaurant starts to provide better training to their managers and team members, or hires a new manager, we will NOT be coming back here again.", "beginning": "We went here for Mother's Day based on the positive", "mgt": "\"We went here for Mother's Day based on the positive reviews we had read online.

Possibly there are regular menu items that we missed by coming in an off peak time, but I doubt we will go back to find out.\\n\\nAlthough we like these kinds of restaurants, especially O Nami in San Diego, this is a poor representation.  The sushi is somewhat fresh, but the fish pieces are too large to eat in one bite and the rice quite small, it was an awkward eating experience.  I particularly dislike combo sushis without any labeling and there was none here.  There are also some hot dishes, such as soups, stir fries, fried noodles, and tempura shrimp and vegetables.  These were not bad, but not worth recommending.  The one thing that probably keeps people coming back is the chocolate fountain, which we are not particularly fond of.  The rest of the desserts are forgettable.\\n\\nBut the one thing that will definitely keep me away was the MSG headache I got less than hour after eating there.

I think it's a good concept and they have some really good style ideas. Nothing they sell is really well-made and assembly is required... considering what it is, it's overpriced.

We went last night, Sunday, and got there about 8 pm (they closed at 9 pm).\\n\\nFirst we walked in, was not sure where to go since it was out first time.  Someone walked by and said the hostess will be back in a few minutes.  So we waited..and waited.  About 15 minutes later a hostess arrived.  We asked to be seated outside since it was beautiful out.  She was annoyed that the table she sat us at was directly against a bench which I kept hitting my elbow on.  We asked to move (there were a lot of tables) which annoyed her even more.  About 15 minutes later our server showed up (granted now the close in 30 minutes).  We asked for a cup of ice and lemons for our water multiple times...never saw those the whole meal.  She came to the table for our order and stated they only had 4 pizza's left so if we wanted pizza we needed to order immediately.  Since we had never been there, looking at the menu for 3-4 minutes was not enough time, but we wanted pizza.  We got a pepperoni like pizza and a sausage and potato white pizza.  We also ordered calamari as a appetizer.  \\n\\nWhen the food came out, all of it came at once.  This is my biggest pet peeve of restaurants!!  Appetizers come before a meal...not with it!  The calamari was nothing to talk about...frozen and bland.  The best thing about it was that we got the lemons with is, so we used those in our water.  The pizzas came out at the same time...again nothing great.  The crust was actually delicious, but there was hardly any cheese on them at all.  We asked for parm cheese, never got that either.  On the potato pizza the potatoes were still hard (under cooked) so we peeled them all off.  The pepperoni was okay, just needed more cheese.  The crust was the best part of the pizza.  \\n\\nThe food was okay...the service was horrible (never got what we asked for, drinks empty whole meal, and rushed to get everything since it was close to closing).

My heart sank after they informed me that we no longer have a room because they were overbooked(was a busy weekend, boxing event). Now why on earth would you continue to book people for the hotel rooms when you know you ran out of rooms!!! Isn't it suppose to be first come first serve?  When you don't have enough rooms to rent out for a particular day, aren't you suppose to stop booking more people! \\n\\nAs I later learned, we weren't the only people that have this problem on that day.

All they told us was that they were sold out and the typical customer service talk. The only thing they did was give us some taxi money and transferred our stay to their sister hotel Mirage(also owned by MGM) for a complimentary stay and refunded us the deposit. \\n\\nIn hindsight, I suspect that they bumped us because there were more people willing to pay for a higher rate that busy weekend. So obviously if they pay more, that'd be more $$ for the hotel. Just weeks before I went, I often checked the price of the rooms and noticed that the rate gone up by 50%+. So it sounds to me that the highest bidder wins.  \\n\\nWhat ever happen to  business integrity?

{"trgt": "Valentine's evening 2013, my wonderful husband surprised me with dinner at this restaurant as we had never been to either the Stratosphere or the restaurant before. I was so looking forward to a wonderful evening with one of my bestest friends and my wonderful husband. Unfortunately the experience as a whole left a bad taste in my mouth. It was a combination of the Management of the facility as well as another diner in the restaurant that honestly I wish I was able to confront for ruining such a wonderful evening.\\n\\nWithout letting that situation put a bias on my review of their food, it was mediocre at best and seriously over-priced for what we had tried to consume before being rudely interupted by the manager. It seems that one of the other diners near us were offended by our laughter and enjoyment, enthusiasm for being together, and certain words that were spoken at my table. The manager then approached our table, looked at me directly and asked that we refrain from these activities immediately. Now please keep in mind I spent well over 200 dollars for dinner and had not even been served as yet. I promptly requested to know whom had made such a request of us, as I intended to embarass and humiliate them as they had done to me. Maybe not the best approach but honestly - who in their right mind is so narcassistic to believe that they are allowed to go out in Public then mandate that the Public behave in the way they deem they should? If you are so easily offended by others, stay at home and don't ever leave.\\n\\nBack to dinner, I gathered my things, my 25 dollar valentine's day dinner picture, my BFF and left my husband to deal with getting our dinner to go. We had split some of the meal with my friend so he had 2 cards and some cash he wanted to give towards the dinner with the intent of giving cash to the waitress after the transaction as a tip (we prefer tipping in cash as we believe the servers are not taxed on this and get to keep more of it - if that makes sense). I am not real clear on what the cash portion my husband provided was for as I think he had wanted to get change from it but it seems the waitress took it upon herself not to return 20 dollars of that cash. Funny, she was going to receive a much larger tip than 20 dollars as she was excellent, it was her manager that was the jerk, but just taking the money and not returning it, allowed us to assume thats all she thought she deserved and we did not offer anything more. \\n\\nAll in all, as I indicated, the food really wasn't all that compared to other places we have been to with similar offerings. The price was not fitting of the quality of food, the service was excellent but that last little action was uncalled for. The manager needs a class in people skills and the only real redeeming quality this place has is that it sits at the top of the Stratosphere, spins and provides a nice view of the strip when your table finally gets there.

Standard soups, fried rice, various chicken and beef dishes, and some seafood. We usually come here for the snow crab legs and the blue crabs, and the shrimp. Unfortunately they didn't have blue crabs yesterday, but the previous other times that we went, they had them and we liked them. The oysters were a bit disappointing yesterday, but in the past they've been alright. \\n\\nThe service is alright. Some servers were more attentive than others. Some would clear our plates a little earlier than they probably should have, but that's not a big deal to me. \\n\\nI did notice that their sushi is pretty good, and they have various steamed buns, peking duck, made to order noodle soups, and even have ventured into a couple more \\\"fusiony\\\" dishes.

{"trgt": "So I have had it with the lousy software updates, with each new rendition of iOS, from 5 to 7, getting worse and worse, as well as introducing new bugs that are not resolved. \\n\\nIn total, I have replaced my iPhone 4 once, and my iPhone 4S TWICE, all within a year of purchase. Usually its some sort of battery charging issue, it goes like this, the phone gets REALLY HOT the day before the battery fails, and very soon after that, it no longer holds a charge. It may stay at one percent, maybe it drops from 100 down to 0 in two hours or less. All THREE of the 4-Series iPhones did this to me. And it usually happens right after a hotfix patch.\\n\\nIn particular, I have had a bad experience with THIS Apple Store. In my final iPhone 4S fiasco, I went back to the Apple Store to get it replaced because its still within the range of one year since purchase. Everything went smoothly, supposedly. \\n\\nThen on my way out with my refurbished replacement model, I was immediately stopped by two of the male Mac geniuses that sort of look alike (they refer each other as \\\"Clark Kents\\\" as some sort of inside joke). They told me to follow them back to the Genius Bar, only for me to realize that apparently I am accused as a thief as they sternly questioned me about \\\"Where was the old iPhone?\\\".  Only then, did the stocky blonde girl (the Concierge), managed to show them that she had it, AFTER I started YELLING at the staff that \\\"the blonde girl has it\\\". She FUCKING LOST THE OLD IPHONE that I gave to her in exchange for the replacement! If I hadn't made the Geniuses drag her ass back out of the break room in the back, I probably would have been arrested for a false felony grand larceny charge. \\n\\nAnd then it got worse, on my embittered way out of the store, NEW replacement phone in hand, the Geniuses actually followed my ass out profusely saying fake apologies. \\n\\n\\nI no longer am one of those Apple fans. There is no amount of empty \\\"Sorry's\\\" and fake smiles that can draw me back. \\n\\n\\nHere is another story, of a different Las Vegas Apple Store experience.\\n\\nMy MacBook Pro, which I bought 3 years ago, is in need of a battery replacement according to the diagnostic tools that its been warning me with. \\n\\nBut, given how I was treated at this store, and the Town Square Location (they aided a thief who stole this very MacBook in reformatting and deleting the Undercover Mac software before selling it to a pawn shop, and I had to call Metro's Property Crimes Division to use the personal information I acquired through screenshots by Undercover to get it back), I refuse to purchase or request services or support from any Apple Retailer. \\n\\nIn fact, I even wrote a negative Yelp review of the Town Square location upon discovery of my stolen MacBook (through Wifi-Router GPS screenshots) a few years ago. I was complimented by many other Yelpers for my \\\"slick detective work\\\" before it was mysteriously deleted months later by Yelp. I included screenshots of a thin caucasian male Apple employee that was reformatting my formerly stolen Mac, this evidence was also taken by my Undercover Mac software. \\n\\nI am considerable getting some sort of Android device as replacement. I realized I should have snapped much earlier, but my older brother is some sort of die-hard Apple fan that really doesn't want to let Steve Job's dream go. \\n\\nI however, am very willing to burn bridges. Especially built by those who turn on not just me, but their crazed consumers. You can Google it, there was a lawyer who sued a Apple Store, search for \\\"Michael Deverett\\\" from Toronto over a plethora of stolen Apple products. He won surprisingly. \\n\\n\\n\\nRight now, I am digging around my laptop to see if I can find those old screenshot photos I have that implicated the Town Square location. But instead of submitting THAT along with photos on Yelp, which would surely be deleted, I am going to put it up on Google Maps.\\n\\n\\nUpdate:\\n\\nFound some of the implicating evidence for the stolen laptop incident years ago at Town Square.

{"trgt": "I think you need to consider the target audience for the Palms in order to truly appreciate it.  To give you an idea, let me explain my view of the archetypal Vegas casinos:\\n  =  Bellagio is catering to the 50+ crowd with the classic styling and the reserved elegance\\n  =  Venetian is great for those in their 40s looking for a lot of variety, or those with families\\n  =  Wynn is luxurious yet modern, perfect for those in their 30s\\n  =  Palms is all marketing hype and youthful abandon, designed to appeal to those in their 20s (or those who think they are still in their 20s)\\n\\nIf you agree with the above, then you'll agree that the Palms does a great job of filling a very important role in the Vegas casino cornucopia.\\n\\nThere are bright colors and lots of action.  It's fairly small (the casino is tiny compared to the mega-resorts), but the new Fantasy Tower almost doubles capacity while adding a new level of excitement.\\n\\nThe rooms in the Fantasy Tower are all brand new, and they've been designed with the metro crowd in mind - very modern, lots of dark woods (think W Hotel or THEhotel).  But the real reason to consider the Palms are the new clubs - Moon and the Playboy Club.\\n\\nThe new Playboy Club is an attempt to take away from the prime targets of THEhotel and the Wynn - young (but not too young) professionals.  The table games in the Playboy Club start at $50 a hand, so you aren't going to get your typical frat boy or sorority sister spilling their Bud Light on you.  The dealers are even more attractive than their profiles on the website, and it's a very dark room, giving it a distinct feel from normal casinos.  There's a $20 cover ($40 on weekends), so it's fairly steep if you don't have a host.  But the Playboy Club is connected to Moon, so you really get 2 clubs for the price of 1.\\n\\nPROS:\\n- Great rooms for the price (the Palms is usually cheaper than hotels on the Strip)\\n- It's on Flamingo Rd, so it's off the Strip and has extremely easy freeway access (perfect for the LA crowd or people with rentals)\\n- Table games generally have lower limits - it's not unusual to find $10 tables even on weekends\\n\\nCONS:\\n- It's not walkable to any other resort, so you need a car or time to take cabs\\n- Although there isn't a conference center in the hotel, the Palms is often sold out - big games, holidays, etc.\\n\\nBEST OF DREW - Vegas-Style!\\n- Best place to stay if price is no object: Four Seasons\\n- Best place to stay for a bachelor party: Palms\\n- Best place to stay for a bachelorette party: Venetian\\n- Best pool area: Mandalay Bay\\n- Best place for a couples getaway: THEhotel at Mandalay Bay", "beginning": "I think you need to consider the target audience for", "mgt": "\"I think you need to consider the target audience for this product.

I cannot tell you how many times this service has come to the rescue for me. \\n\\nI absolutely love the Bandfield staff.

It was so bad that after the third course, my BF said he had enough and wanted to go eat something that's edible, but being Chinese I insisted we trudge on through as to not let food go to waste.

(A running theme of Robuchon.)\\n3B) Grilled Spiny Lobster...Came out cold. I asked the Waiter, if this is normal, he said he will check with the kitchen and redo it. When he came back with the new dish, he made a jeering remark to the gist of, \\\"Next time, don't take so long to take photos.\\\" WTF? Taking a couple of shots is not long enough to turn a dish cold.\\n\\nThan came the longest wait in the world for the fourth course. WE WAITED ALMOST AN HOUR FOR THE NEXT COURSE. Nobody came to apologize. There is no way that they didn't know about this because an integral part of fine dining is the timing of the dishes of when they are served. \\n \\n4A) Roasted duck...Okay.\\n4B) Beef cheeks...It was very tender, but the sauce was average. \\n\\nThe Mashed Potatoes. It was ahhhmazing. If this was the only course served, than Joel deserves 5 stars. Just give me a bucket of this and I am a happy camper.  \\n\\n5) Instead of Cheese Course we requested a substitute and they gave us the Risotto of Soybeans Sprouts. It was so salty...inedible.

Nice gesture, but the entire event was strange.  They will serve you a slice and the rest of the cake is thrown away. What a waste.\\n\\nAt the end of the meal, they roll out this beautiful dessert cart and tell you choose whatever mignardises you want. However, you are not allowed to take any of it to go. Huh?

Stacy takes pride in her work and does such a great job even with my stubborn leg hairs, I am a challenge and she wins every time! Knowing you can go back if you ever need a touch up is great, but I have yet needed to go back. \\n\\nThe children's room is such a great idea for those moms just wanting to keep up with waxing without the expense of a sitter, A+ for that idea. They have great products from the body scrub (that I use daily) to the lotion that actually moisturizes and all great prices and there is always a deal going on you can catch for a discount. \\n\\nPrices are very reasonable and no excuse to not afford it because they have countless deals and promotions, check them out on FaceBook or just call for deals. \\n\\nThis Yelper Highly Recommends The Birthday Suit", "beginning": "What makes The Birthday Suit unique is that THEY CARE.", "mgt": "What makes The Birthday Suit unique is that THEY CARE.

Not kid friendly, no strollers allowed unless you are a guest and the \\\"elegant\\\" dining restaurants don't accept children younger then 5.  We got a king suite for $149 a night with a $50 resort credit.  Since we can't dine at the nicer places, we chose the buffet, which was a nice surprise.  Paid $35 a person, charged to room to use the resort credit.  Ate one too many alaskan crab legs and felt sick.  I still haven't manage to control myself at buffets.  No matter how slow or how little I get, I always wound up overeating.  I think the liege waffle pushed me over.  Watched alot of tourists munch on the pizza ($35 for cheese pizza?).  Hotel was able to provide a crib for our 10 month old.  It is a smaller crib, not the normal full size.  If you have a big baby, he/she might feel claustrophobic.  The bumper seems dense and worried me a little but our little one is not that mobile yet.  Overall suite was very nice, we had a view of Circus Circus.  The morning coffee was a disappointment.  Their coffee bar is right near the elevators and was a tad expensive for the type of coffee you get.  Don't get the breakfast croissant sandwiches, oily and greasy, felt ripped off for paying $9 for that crap.

I ordered the local special, which came with pepper jack cheese, guacamole, and jalapeno slices.  Everything was very fresh, even the guacamole.

It was certainly more than enough food, just caught me off guard.\\n\\nOverall, it was a very good sandwich, and I enjoyed the sweet potato fries as well.  The only reason it gets 3 stars instead of 4 is that it's a little on the pricey side.  $12 for my sandwich, a water, and some sweet potato fries.

Being a huge Dale Eardhardt Jr Fan, its only natural to want to check this place out, good or bad reviews.\\n\\nFinding this place can be fun, its located on the second floor of a shopping area right along side the charlotte hornets arena. Be advised you probably will have to pay 6-8 dollars for parking and walk to the place.\\n\\nFirst of all i went here for lunch so this place was not \\\"hoppin\\\", nor was it busy when i got there. The building seems to have two halves, a club side and a food side. THe club side was blocked off kind of and was empty. Walking in my first thoughts were kind of disappointing. Nothing really \\\"racey\\\" feeling about it, yes i know its not a racecar bar but yet kind of figured it would have some kind of feeling reminding you what the place was about or where it came from.\\n\\nTypical bar style room with the bar in the center and tall tables around it. Waitress took at least 10 minutes to come greet us after we were seated. Then our order took good at least 20-25 minutes to arrive, she kept saying she was going to check on the status then would walk over to another table. The more guest our waitress had, the longer we had to wait for refills and our check. All the female workers seem close so they focused on gossiping  more with each other while they walk past our table failing to notice my empty glass could use a refill.\\n\\nFood was okay, had the \\\"Dale Q\\\" i think it was called, was a burger with shredded pork on it. Really didnt have alot of taste to it, had to add the bbq sauce to give it some kind of taste. However i did order the waffle sweet potato fries and those were excellent!\\n\\nOverall i left kind of bummed, just guess i need to visit it at nighttime. It seems being open for lunch, they only run the bare minimum staff and that effects everyone as more guest arrive for lunch.\\n\\nOh side note, dont get too excited if you see the mason jar they offer with your soda drink for 8 bucks, its plastic and a total letdown.

It's a madhouse, with people packing the tiny corridor leading from the bar to the restaurant. The greeter was screaming at the top of her lungs for people, managing to sound pretty pissed off in the process. \\n\\nWe were seated at 9:55, and this was after a handful of people in front of us left because of the wait. We sat around for a few minutes before someone slapped this cup of butter on the table. Me and my date sat transfixed. Was the butter ornamental? Would it go good with a dash of pepper? We stared at this shot glass full of butter for a full fifteen minutes before someone gave us bread. We were seated with two other tables simultaneously, and while we waited for our appetizer, the first table was on their entrees. The second table was polishing off their appetizer while we munched on prison bread. The butter didn't help much.\\n\\nI got the filet, medium rare. Completely raw in the middle, mostly raw for the rest of it. Baked potato was microwaved. A baked potato will be crispy on the outside. This is a direct result of the baking. A microwaved potato will be one big rubbery mess that slides around your plate. \\n\\nWe chose the peach melba for dessert. It was melted soft serve ice cream topped with cool whip and canned peaches. There were a few raspberries, but after the first one's extreme sourness I decided to leave the rest to drown in vanilla soup. The blueberries were completely devoid of any flavor, good or bad. If you've ever eaten paper, you'll know what I'm talking about.\\n\\nAt the end, we were presented our check boasting that we would have had to pay $89.99 for this travesty.

The tip wasn't much.\\n\\nA few other notes. The interior is weird. I can figure why-- this is a dive tavern that someone picked up on the cheap for the nice location. They threw in a few large windows facing the city and left the rest to rot. I was able to carbon date the carpet back to the paleolithic age, when orange and green was in style. Every flat surface is full of drywall stalactites, which adds a nice sex-dungeon flair to the place. A fake fireplace crackles and flickers orange.

Had two back-to-back horrible business deals with this Chapman Autoplex and will not, I repeat, WILL NOT, ever be back. I got cornholed bigtime on my last Dodge in 2003. Me and a couple other co-workers bought from a sneaky and unscrupulous sales woman named Kim Chartier back in 98 or so and I should have learned back then not to come back to this dealership. All of us got screwed in so many ways that it will take me two hours to state what happened. Years later, we still joke about this dealership and how bad we got it. My friend Debbie L bought two or three used vehicles from Kim C and she almost needed therapy when she realized how bad she got screwed, and she could have saved alot of money buying from someone else.I turned in a leased car back to them in 2003 (dont ever lease-sales reps make more commission on leases) therefore I was talked into one when I could have bought the car for $10 more a month. Costly mistake.  And before my lease on my Dodge Neon ended and I still had another payment left, they talked me into ending my lease a month early so i can get sold another Dodge-well they were supposed to make my last lease payment for me and of course, they didn't, and I got stuck with two payments for one month. Also, my interest rate was almost a point higher than I was quoted over the phone-when I went to sign the Chrysler Financial papers, the sales manager was no where to be found, and someone else was left in charge of it. When I confronted the sales manager the next day,  he said I could have free car detailing for the entire time I owned the car!! What good is this when I am not coming back??  I should have walked when the interest rate was higher than he told me over the phone but but I needed a car, was in a bind,  and wanted this horrible experience over with. I was also sold a useless extended warranty that I could have negotiated down in price, but once again, the gal that sold me this made her money and thats all that matters.  After a couple more hiccups with the paperwork, and another issue with my turned in leased car, I called to complain to the head manager, Johnny Lemke- what a jerk, very rude to me, and basically said it wasnt his problem and if I didnt get anything in writing, they won't honor it.I will never buy a Dodge again, never buy an extended warranty-they are a scam and don't cover anything, and I will never deal with this dealership again.  After my experience with them and some issues with my turned in leased vehicle, I got to fight ANOTHER battle with Wells Fargo Auto Lease Finance-totally different story there but I won it, with no help  from the Chapman fu**tards. This dealership did nothing to guide me through turning in my leased vehicle either- I  think they should have recommended me do some stuff as I was buying another  vehicle from them. Nope. You need to do your research on turning in a leased vehicle and don't expect anyone at the dealership to save you any money or give you any useful advice. You need to ask the bank that you're leasing from, where their lot is and turn the vehicle in there. If you leave it at Chapman or another dealership, you will be charged a pick up fee. I ended up beating this and not paying but don't rely on the dealership to make this an easy transition. I hope the knuckleheads that were here back in 2003 are gone. And by the way, my junk Dodge Stratus was totaled when I got hit by a drunk driver- the POS was an even bigger POS and insurance paid it off and paid my GAP insurance so I got rid of the car and wasn't stuck with it any longer. Words of advice: do not lease, do not purchase extended warranties, do not do business with Chapman, and buy from private sellers people- it is cheaper and they are more honest.

There was alot of soap and hard water residue left behind, I could run my hand over the tiles and my hand was very chalky.

I didn't say anything about the 2nd shower to them as I already felt very uncomfortable  about them coming back to re-clean, knowing that I complained about their cleaning.  (I really don't like addressing a job that is not well done with someone, they look at you cross, like how dare you complain about the job I performed) \\n\\nLater that night I started to unpack the boxes and get my house in order and that's when I really started noticing how dirty everything was still. I paid  for a deep move in clean. There was no furniture in the house so nothing in the way of them being able to clean all the nooks and crannies. I paid extra for all the windows, sliders and inside the cabinets and fridge to be cleaned.

There was still dirt & crumbs in several of the drawers, and dirt in corners of the cabinets. \\n\\nThe slider and window tracts were supposed to be cleaned as part of the window cleaning that I paid extra for, they were not cleaned very well, there was still dirt & grime in them. There was debris/particles all along the baseboards, in every room, that were not vacuumed. Dirt left in corners of the tile floors. They did a surface clean, but not a very thorough deep clean, which is what I paid for.

As far as a bar for a mid-week after-work drink and munchies goes, it's pretty good. I've heard amazing things about their burgers and hot dogs. I will be back to try these (the burgers come with two patties per bun?!)\\n\\nWhen I came, I tried a Grapefruit Mojito and it was really fresh and delicious. When a bar isn't specifically a 'cocktail bar' I can be very suspicious. So many times a cocktail can come unmuddled, or with chunky ice instead of crushed, and it can just taste like watery, alcohol with a sprinkling of fruit. Not at The Huxley. I happened to meet the mixologist at the bar, who was very proud of all his creations (he has made all the recipes) and was really keen to make some cocktails for me. I love this kind of energy and passion. There were some delicious looking numbers there too.\\n\\nThe food menu is also really unusual, inspired and different. Hot dogs are, well, so hot right now.

I gave this place a 2nd star as a benefit of the doubt.. perhaps I just happened to have picked a bad day to eat at this place.\\n\\nFirst, the service was HORRIBLE.  We asked for a table for 3, and instead of simply pulling an extra chair up two a 2-seated table, the waitress sat us at a table for 6, only to have a party of 8 walk in the door a minute after I had started on my soup, so she asked us to move to a different table so they could have our table.  This wouldn't have been so bad if it was the only problem we ran into for the night.\\n\\nNext, because the staff was in such a rush to move us, they took my salad away before I was actually finished with it.  Not a great way to start my all-you-can-eat experience.\\n\\nThird, when we put in our sushi order, the waitress had to clarify whether we were ordering nigiri per order (2 pieces) or per piece.  We specified that we wanted 2 pieces for every number we indicated on the sushi sheet.  She nodded and brought our order to the chef.  The first half of our order came out fine. We got the number of pieces we asked for, but when the 2nd half of our order came out, the sushi chef decided to interpret our orders as \\\"per piece\\\" so we only received one piece of every sushi ordered on the bottom half of the order sheet.  I guess it's no big deal, since we could always order more, but it took us a good 45 minutes just to get all of this order, we didn't know how much longer we'd have to wait to order everything again.  \\n\\nThe staff was also bad with keeping up with who they had already served soup & salad to and who they have not served yet (I happened to receive mine, but the person who showed up later in our group got nothing), and they were slow at refilling drinks too.  It might be because they got busy after the 1st hour we were there, but we wouldn't have dined for 2.5 hours if their service wasn't as slow.  \\n\\nAlso, the three sushi chefs who were working all disappeared at the same time, and were gone for about 5 minutes.  What kind of restaurant leaves the sushi bar completely unattended during the peak dinner hour?!?!?!\\n\\nAside from the service, the food selection was not great as it did not really include any appetizers, had limited all-you-can-eat sushi selection, and did not include any dessert.  We could've driven another 2 minutes down the block to another sushi restaurant that could've provided all the above mentioned items with same quality or even better quality fish than Sushi Kee for the same all-you-can-eat price of $20 per person.  \\n\\nAs for food quality, it was pretty decent.  It is among some of the freshest quality fish I've had in sushi restaurants, but there are definitely plenty of other places that could provide better quality fish as well.  The quality of Sushi Kee's fish is not enough to bring be back here again.\\n\\nIn summary, I would not go back to eat here knowing that Mido Sushi's only a block away.  I also would not recommend any of my friends to eat here either.  While the food quality was ok, the service and poor food selection definitely ruined the experience for me.

It was very juicy and tender, which is difficult to do with med-rare duck.  I enjoyed it most out of everything.

{"trgt": "The folks behind lbs, Holstein's and a few other of my top burger spots in town just opened up The Barrymore at the little-known Royal Resort just off the Strip, and I was more than excited to see what else they had in store for me. I've read a few things about the place since it opened, plus the pictures of the interior looked like my kind of spot so I really had some high hopes that I would be walking into my next go-to restaurant. All of these things surely added up to a great burger right? Not so much.\\n\\nThe restaurant itself has a great interior; contemporary, hip, kind of reminds me of the Vintner Grill but maybe a little fancier. There is a really small bar at the front, and I think two different dining rooms, seating a total of only 50 people I think so reservations are probably recommended. The Royal Resort is pretty cool as well, the lobby could still use a bit of work with their ceiling tiles for example, but I'm sure the average person won't notice this.\\n\\nThe menu looks great, I would definitely go back to try many of the items that sounded delicious, but as usual I'm there for only one thing. I did manage to sneak in the lobster mac & cheese before the burger came out; it was decent but not amazing for $13. I've also heard from many people that they have a fantastic cocktail menu which I wasn't totally in the mood for on this visit but would definitely be willing to go back for.\\n\\nThe Steakhouse Burger on the menu is listed as grass-fed beef patty, bacon marmalade, gruyere cheese, frisee, oven-roasted tomatoes and garlic aioli. That's quite a lot of flavors packed into one assembly, and I was almost nervous as to whether all of those would be able to stand out or if some would overpower the others. The burger came out with a very strange looking bun, and pinned with a wooden steak with the lbs logo on it which I thought was odd, but made me even more excited because I haven't had a bad burger there yet. Maybe it's because we weren't actually at lbs but this wasn't up to par. The meat had good flavor, was definitely cooked medium-rare as ordered, but the toppings and bun added up to something just short of working for me. As predicted, I think the toppings all kind of got lost together, although if you isolated and pulled out individual bites of each they were quite good. The bacon marmalade was probably my favorite, and the bun really detracted from everything for me. The bun to meat ratio was ok, but the bun itself was very dry and just really odd. Overall it was ok, but not at all what I was hoping for.\\n\\nThe fries were good; they had a bit of seasoning and good flavor, and luckily were included with the price of the burger otherwise I'd say the $6 for a side order of them is a bit much. My friend ordered asparagus instead of the fries and we were sadly charged an additional $7. I understand that some menu changes come with an additional fee, but I wasn't too crazy about that line item on our bill even given the 'fanciness' of the restaurant. If we hadn't done any strange swaps, our meal would have come to $27 for the two burgers which isn't horrible given the location just off the Strip as well as the interior of the restaurant, unfortunately I thought the burger was just ok. My friend liked hers, but I thought it could be better. If you want to spend about the same on a really great burger I'd say go to Holstein's if you're on the strip or lbs if you're out in the suburbs.

Entering the prep room, the nurse inserting the IV poked and missed so many times my vein collapsed and my hand swelled up like a football and they had to move to the other hand, all the while, all she could talk about was the tatto on my wrist, which is a memorial to my son who had recently passed. This, of course, upsetting, depressing, and irritating me right before surgery. Again, really??  Upon waking in recovery, I had major spinal surgery. My entire lower lumbars were fused with an unbelievable amount of hardware. My surgeon, who is not a resident doctor there, was wonderful. Sorry to say, this hospital was too far under his league of expertise. I woke from surgery to an 10 inch incision in my abdominal area and an 8 inch incision in my back, 42 staples, and an indescribable level of pain. I was given no pain control whatsoever. I laid in recovery like this for 9 hours before I was given a room. In the meantime, my husband and other son were waiting in the waiting room for 15 hours at this point, not being told anything about my condition, and when asked, they were told I just went home by a nurse who was impatient and uncaring and didn't bother to check for them. They had to ask another nurse, who finally found out that I finally got into a room, and was told a room number and I was there. They got to the room to find I was not only not there, but it wasn't even my room. When they finally got the right room, they sat and waited there because I wasn't even out of recovery yet. Incompetent.  Once in my room, the nurses were huffy, uncaring, impatient and rude. I was left with no pain control for 24 hours before my surgeons assistant came and took care of it herself. Every time I needed assistance, I had to call for a nurse repeatedly, only to get results when I became loud out of pain and frustration. Every person there during my visit was incompetent, rude, obviously hated their jobs, uncaring, in compassionate, and god forbid if it was time for a shift change. Never, in my life, will I ever, ever, EVER recommend this cold, heartless, thoughtless, rude, uncaring, in compassionate so called hospital/staff.

{"trgt": "With the energy-charged locomotive of urban rejuvenation happening in Downtown Vegas, it's with much excitement that we ventured our way to it's newest arrival, Eat.\\n\\nFrom what I gathered, Eat is a casual venue, similar to a diner, but with a hipper atmosphere and a focus on quality-driven, locally sourced comfort food.  We have been waiting for this kind of establishment for a long time; Vegas definitely needs an urban identity with a sense of community away from commercial strip centers and suburban hubs.  Downtown is growing into it's own, shedding it's identity crisis of yesteryear.\\n\\nAs the surroundings are still a bit shaky, the actual building was in good solid condition and the parking around the corner gave a sense of safety and comfort (still faintly reminiscent of 'The Walking Dead' with Zombies eerily meandering the streets)....\\n\\nAnd as soon as you walk in, you feel a new presence has just emerged, a real sense of place.  We immediately fell in love-the interior is cool but not over-designed, an instantly inviting atmosphere that make you want to stay and enjoy what the kitchen has to offer. I had a terribly good feeling about Eat; and in my mind I was already coming back to eat...\\n\\nWe're gushing over the design and atmosphere, but in all truth; Vegas restaurants outside of the Strip have much to be desired in terms of decor.  Many have great food, but are so lacking in interiors that are actually humane, (not some graphic design nightmare or some catalogue cookie cutter interior), some don't even bother with any decorations-it's bereft of joy...\\n\\nWe were so excited that we decided to sit at the communal table (totally our last choice for seats in normal circumstances, but it was centrally located and we could see the entire room from that table). Loving every moment and excited for our Brunch!\\n\\nAnd we were in front of the open kitchen, so we could see all the action! Being that we came on a weekend, Eat was serving the Brunch menu which is our favorite meal of the day!  I was so excited, since I though we had missed breakfast and they had the most interesting items in the morning!\\n\\nWell, it was at the top of the menu and we couldn't resist ordering the Beignets dusted in Powder Sugar with a side of Jam and Vanilla Marscapone. It was a really great way to start off the meal and it was perfect with the Coffee!  BTW the table is set with Mugs and condiments in the center of the Communal table and Counter which is a great feature - kudos!\\n\\nI came in thinking I was gonna order one thing, but I ended up really cheating on my cheat day; The Chicken Fried Steak smothered in Country Gravy + Two Eggs Over Easy + Smashed Potatoes + possibly the best Rye Toast I've ever had!!\\n\\nI relished this dish, the chicken fried steak had the best crunchy texture that contrasted effortlessly  with the creamy/chunky gravy that was....really to die for.  It was a comforting country breakfast that I knew would last me all throughout the day and well into the evening.  The Eggs were cooked perfectly, Ioved scooping up the yolk with the thick cut pieces of Rye toast and the Potatoes sent me into overdrive...\\n\\nBy our waiter's suggestion, Rick order the Huevos Motulenos: Two Eggs Over Easy + Red and Green Chili Sauce + Black Beans + Green Peas + Feta Cheese +Sauteed Banana all on a Corn Tortilla.  WOW...the flavors bursted with vibrance, but the real game changer was the Sauteed Banana-it elevated this dish!! I had no idea that this one ingredient could really create a whole different flavor profile that made me fall head over heels in love! The sweetness toned the hot spicy Chiles and added a gentler texture.\\n\\nWe also ordered a side of the Chicken Apple Sausage which was extremely juicy and satisfying!  There wasn't one thing that we ordered that we wouldn't get again in a heartbeat-everything was amazing....\\n\\nAnd as any proud owner would, Chef Natalie came to each table and asked how the meal was, and we couldn't have been more happier with the food, the service and the ambience!  Eat is surely a destination restaurant and a definite must for anyone who has a love for comfort food and desire to patronize local businesses that work so hard to delivery great experiences!  We are devoted fans and will soon become regulars at Eat!!\\n\\n\\nRatings (Out of FiveStars)\\nFood:           5\\nService:       5\\nAmbience:   5\\n\\nPERFECT SCORE!!!", "beginning": "With the energy-charged locomotive of urban rejuvenation happening in Downtown", "mgt": "\"With the energy-charged locomotive of urban rejuvenation happening in Downtown, the atmosphere is electric, drawing in both locals and tourists alike.

The customer service agent said that while they apologized for all the errors on their side, they would only reimburse half of our delivery fee and that they would deliver the correct piece in two more days (5 days after the promised delivery date) and it's at this point that I informed them that I would not accept this and that I wanted them to return the product. The delivery man for some reason got mad at me and rushed back into the house to grab the other pieces of furniture that was already delivered the night before and off they went. He informed me that they would refund my money until all of the pieces were returned back to the warehouse so now my fingers are crossed that this truly happens. I have never had such a poor experience with a furniture company and will not shop here again. \\n\\nSuch a shame - my wife and I were big fans of the furniture displayed here and the prices too.

The fatoosh is 3/4 rice, which is awesome if you love rice, not awesome if you are looking for a light flavorful salad that is typical with fatoosh. The kicker, the manager and other servers wiped up tables that were considerably messy that had children seated at them with DRY napkins. No bleach/ disinfectant / wet towels used.

The last show we saw there was Motley Crue and we stayed at a hotel down the street but getting a cab back at 3:30 in the morning sucks plus we had to leave the next day so this was an easier option. We booked a room in the Hard Rock Tower and it was spacious with a nice set up and very clean. The lights didn't work in the shower and we couldn't hook up our iPhone 5s to the sound system in the room so that was a bummer but we still liked the set up. \\n\\nThe pools could be nice b/c they are huge and there are different styles - like one with a sandy bottom, waterfalls, and islands to hang out on.

The worst part about that is you can actually see a bunch of nastiness floating in the pool - oil, what looks to be skin, and hair. It really freaks me out but we knew going there the Hard Rock is known for their party atmosphere especially poolside. In my 20s i would have been into the huge party scene at the pool but being a fresh 40 year old, I am over that stuff. I liked a quiet pool with less people. The Hard Rock is complete opposite - people throwing balls back and forth, everyone is wasted or on their way to that point, music is blaring louder than a night club, and girls grinding on each other to impress tatted out muscle dudes they never met. We spent about 90 minutes poolside each day b/c we went for GNR not for hanging at the pool. \\n\\nMr. Lucky's is the 24 hour restaurant and it's where I had the WORST meal I ever ate.

Their happy hour is really good, they make amazing drinks - Bourbon Mules, a Dark and Stormy, or if you fancy tequila they have a great selection of spirits. And all their juices are freshly muddled.

{"trgt": "THE GOOD: \\n1.) CONVENIENT - Late night food alternative that is close enough to the strip. \\n2.)

MOSTLY TASTY GRUB - The tacos and burritos are pretty good. However, their Menudo really hits the spot....especially after a cold crazy night.\\n\\nTHE BAD: \\n1.) FOOD SUPPLY - They often run out of certain food items.\\n2.) FOOD QUALITY - There have been some menu items that was definitely a miss and not a hit (might just be bad preparation). \\n2.) INCONSISTENT SERVICE - Sometimes the service sucks.THEY FORGOT MY BURRITO!!! \\n3.) RUNDOWN VENUE - The restaurant is kinda cheesy: jacked up jukebox busting out the Mexican music, the old school tables/chairs, and the cleanliness of the front counter definitely doesn't win \\\"positive\\\" awards. \\n4.)

Our waiter failed to mention that the vegetarian dishes listed w/the tasting menu can be ordered a la carte until we asked whether they have side dishes.  When I pointed to the warm corn terrine, he instead brought the foie gras.  Big difference.  When we alerted the staff, they just said, 'well, i can take it back or you can eat it.'  Which the rest of the party did. And was charged. The corn terrine never appeared.  Did I mention that I told him specifically that I'm pregnant and couldn't have certain foods (to my sadness), such as foie gras, soft cheeses, rare meat. A full conversation.  But apparently, he isn't paid to listen.  Because   my medium filet (again, no rare meat) was presented still mooing. After it was sent back, it came back still kicking around.  AT that point, I just ate the end piece and was done with it.  Look, if that particular kitchen usually goes the rarer side, you need to tell the diner, and she/he will order appropriately.  Onto dessert; what a dissapointment.  Half the dessert menu requires that you order it 25 minutes prior.  This included the souffle.  Which was gelatinous.  The entire table had a taste and wouldn't eat the remaining.  \\n\\nI eat out.  A lot. And I've been to some of the best restaurants in the world, and not all of them expensive (that falafel joint in Marais (Paris)!) but Alize should really just give up already.

There are so many great French restaurants in Vegas; if you want to impress, go to Joel Robuchon, Bouchon, Guy Savoy. Don't even bother with this place.

Like I said she wasn't rude - just did the bare minimum of service - we saw her when she took our drink order, when she served drinks then immediately took meal order, the delivery of our food and when it was time for the check.  She did ask once during the meal how everything was.  The rest of the time it seemed like she chatted with her sister and her date. \\n\\n3.)

And when you are talking on your phone through an entire at bat, standing up right in the middle of a crucial pitch to get more ballpark chow or allowing your children to turn empty seats into their own personal jungle gym or hide and go seek game, why even come to the stadium? Go to the mall or visit a park for that matter. Regardless of whether you're in first place or last place, this is your team in your city. It's not enjoyable to see such beauty go to waste.

My hubby got the farm burger with the fried egg and duck bacon. Wow. I mean. There are no words for that burger. Except maybe crazy delicious.

{"trgt": "I've lived here for about a year now so I figure it's safe that I've experienced everything I need to for making a review. I'll make this simple via pros/cons. \\n\\nPros:  I like the style of the building and it's proximity to downtown and the freeways. Pretty easy to get to many different spots from this location via I-15/95 to 215. The staff that work in security, valet, HOA, and maintenance are all quite friendly. Parking for guests is valet only which is nice so they don't have to park on the side/back which is a pretty shady area. Another reviewer posted about valet blocking the inbound parking entrance, that has been recently changed and the valet is now due West at the entrance loop thus no longer blocking the inbound lane. The building is VERY secure. Current regulations do not allow guests in the building and up the elevators without being escorted by a resident. Cameras at all entrances, in all elevators; have not noticed any in the garage. Key fobs to get in from garage, from lobby to elevators and inside elevator to your floor. This place has become locked down like no other place in town.  The gym is a very nice and clean facility. The pool, while nice and generally clean, is a bit stark in its design and landscape/hardscape design. The lobby and common areas are kept quite clean; likely varies by floor and if you happen to live with slobs on your floor...mine is pretty good in this regard. I've only used the concierge for dry cleaning and that is a nice feature to have. Choose Tiffany cleaners, not the other company they are setup with. \\n\\nCons: The majority of the units only have one assigned parking spot deeded with the unit and the spots are about 20% more narrow than they should be...cramped and door dings possible. The recent security lock down due to hookers, pimps, drug dealers inhabiting the place creates a big inconvenience for us normal folk. Guest drives up, security calls you, you grant access to valet, guest walks to security desk in lobby and you must come down to the lobby to escort them up to your unit; pain in the ass. I get the reasoning behind this rule and hope if/when the thugs and losers are kicked out we can go back to the proper system of security sending the guest directly to your floor electronically as it should be. The area around the building...shady and crime ridden. Do not walk north of the property alone or at night is all I can say. Laundry in the units is a horrible one piece stacked unit...it's loud and will ruin your laundry quickly. Water pressure delivered to the unit is horrible. I've had people out three times to resolve, still horrible. I feel sorry for those that have long hair as you will not properly rinse out the shampoo with this low of a pressure. Should you wish to take a bath...plan ahead!  It takes 24.5 minutes to fill my tub; yes I timed it. The tub/shower combo is a poor design...the outter edge is round; it's hard to explain but good luck keeping water INSIDE the shower when you use it, your floor will be wet and you've been warned :-)\\n\\nOverall I'd give this place a 2.5-2.75 if I could but felt somewhat generous due to the cleanliness and friendly staff. Not sure how long I'll stay...grass is always greener you know?  Price per square foot is high if you compare to a normal apartment or house but is lower than the overall Vegas price per square foot for hi-rises.", "beginning": "I've lived here for about a year now so I", "mgt": "\"I've lived here for about a year now, so I feel I can provide a well-rounded perspective.

The waiter came over to check on us numerous times to see how we were doing. Then he brings the food out. GOOD GOD! Talk about a feast for the gods, my schnitzel was cooked perfect. The gravy that come on it was also perfect. Flavorful and delicious! The red cabbage was also cooked to perfection. Takes me back to when I was a child, eating German food with my family. After I was done with my entree, I had to order the strudel (apple) and wow, it was amazing. Talk about putting the cherry on the sundae. It was a perfect ending to an amazing meal.

For one, I was told (though I didn't actually see this) that there are sound booths where you can plug in your iPod and send music directly to the DJ.  That's pretty much where the good stuff ends.

The decor was beautiful and from the moment we walked in the service was superb. Looking at the menu I was excited to try a number of things. I settled on their house sangria, bbq chicken pizza and the blue cheese truffle chips. As soon as J heard that red snapper was the fish special of the day he knew he had to order it. We were both really impressed with the truffle chips, they melted in my mouth and I could have made an entire meal out of them.

About 15 minutes later he came back with another piece of fish and had J cut into it while he was standing there and sure enough the fish was raw again. Another 15 minutes later he came back out and the fish was no longer raw (yay) but as J was eating it he didn't have much to say except for the fact that it was now so overcooked that it was dry and had lost most of the flavor. By this time it was late, he was hungry and didn't want to wait for yet another piece of fish so he still ate it. A few minutes after finishing our entrees we got a surprise from our server who brought us coffee and a phenomenal chocolate souffle on the house due to the errors with the fish.

Much to my surprise, I was completely amazed. After an orientation, completing a form (which included a notice of a $500 fee if you defecated in the water!) and watching a short video, I was off to my private room to shower and soak. The silent and dark, with the lid closed, option sounded like the best way to fully immerse myself into this experience.

{"trgt": "My friend warned me about Spirit Airlines. It is a budget airline and if you want to travel a short distance at cheaper discounted prices, you can come here.

For the first 15 minutes that the plane was in the air, the entire cabin was shaking around so much that the passengers started to hold on tightly to the walls of the plane. I felt nauseous by how much the plane was dropping up and down and twisting around. It didn't feel safe at all. \\n\\nThe second issue is that most of the flights are delayed. The planes arrive late frequently and it's hard to get to another connecting flight if it is an unreliable airline.\\n\\nThird issue is the customer service through the phone. I tried calling the 1-800 number for baggage service and information about the airline. There are only four options and you can not speak to a single operator. The phone line hangs up on you after 10 seconds if you don't respond. \\n\\nUnreliability is one thing. Just because you consider yourself a discount airline doesn't mean you should be making your flights not safe for your passengers. I'm sorry, but that is where I draw the line.

We had two trainers and the owner to help out with the class, and they were very encouraging while also making sure we maintained our form and were working out safely.

Holy cow...it didn't last .5 of a millisecond in my mouth. It was that bad. How in the world can a piece of spare rib be that bad? It tasted like gasoline...and it may have been. You get the idea. Food was old (like left over from the previous day or something, not fresh). Here's the kicker: despite 2 for 1 coupons and/or 2 free buffets, the breakfast and lunch lines were very minimal. The hotel guests probably read the reviews about this buffet and stayed away. Me? I thought maybe I could save $50 by going to this buffet with the 2 free coupons and invest it elsewhere. Bad decision. The insult is they actually charge $20.95 for this buffet to those who don't have coupons. They should PAY people $20.95 for coming to eat there. I should thank my stars that I at least got fed for free BUT when you're on vacation in Vegas and you have to make meals count cuz there are only 3 meals a day you should at least enjoy your meal. This buffet was horrible, putrid, old, stanky, and absolutely insulting. A Vegas buffet shouldn't be this bad. The downtown Vegas buffets were even better than this for 1/3 the cost. Treasure Island, please wake up, and guests STAY AWAY from this buffet. First time I've stayed at this hotel, and the rooms were actually pretty good, but the buffet actually ruined the experience.", "beginning": "How in the world can you mess up spare ribs?", "mgt": "\"How in the world can you mess up spare ribs?

I was hoping to order a Mongolian style beef but since their Mongolian sauce is not spicy as indicated, I tried the black pepper instead and unfortunately they only have \\\"steak\\\" not beef. And it was the lowest quality of steak I have ever had, no exaggeration, it was literally beef jerky chunks, and to top it off (literally) it was layed over soggy fried rice (due to the black pepper sauce).  I am shocked people like their meals on top of each other like that.  Even Panda Express separates their dishes.  The lo mein noodles really didn't differ from Panda express except that it had some veggies here and there and dumped a cup of sugar in it, and for $9 with bland \\\"crispy\\\" yet dry chicken I will say that it was another disappointment.

The music is authentic, the production is delicate, and the theme is a triumph. This is a must-see from Cirque du Soleil when you hit Vegas. \\n\\nThe music is impeccable; every single sound comes from MJ and his work. Imagine MJ's original voice recording on IMAX quality output. It feels as if you were listening to him live. \\n\\nThe theme is a triumph: extolling the king, embodiment of the immortal. This is shown by the arrangement: no one can singly represent the King. It is the culmination of the entire cast and audience that renders MJ's presence.

In a nutshell, this is not fully a circus show, a concert, or a dance show. This is MJ. \\n\\nYou are paying for the beautiful production.

Finally another bouncer saw us getting into an argument and helped me out. So for the most part, still a fun night. But unusually mean bouncer man, you need to get fired. He's shorter than most girls and does nothing but look mean all night. Power trip? I think yes. \\n\\nSecond time I go there is on a Friday night. Granted we got free drinks. No one was under the age of 35. Nothing's wrong with that, just not my crowd. Not a lot of dancing, more drinking. The evil bouncer was there again, looking just as miserable as he did the last time I was there. \\n\\nOne plus side was, they had really good music playing both nights.

{"trgt": "Highly disappointed with our dining experience last night. I'd say that for the amount of money that we spent, we could've gotten a much better meal somewhere else. When we got to the restaurant, they told us it was going to be about a 15-30 minute wait ... we got our table in about 5 minutes. Good start! We were browsing through the menu & trying to make a decision during which time our waiter came by twice & asked if we had any questions. We said that we still needed a little bit of time but he was helpful in answering questions we had about the menu.\\n\\nWe decided on the Seafood Platter with a lobster bisque & the Crispy Alaskan Salmon. The Crispy Alaskan Salmon was pictured on the front of their menu & it looked like a hearty piece of salmon topped with plump shrimps & scallop on a bed of saut\\u00e9ed spinach ... my plate didn't reflect that. The salmon was cooked great (I had asked for it well done rather than the normal medium-rare to rare) whereas the shrimp were just okay - one was overcooked and one was not. The scallop was really squishy (for a lack of a better word) & the few pieces of crabmeat that were added to the plate were tasteless & could've been left off. Honestly, I think it would've made for a really good dish if the fish was served by itself next to some rice pilaf or steamed vegetables ... I would've much rather preferred that. As far as the Seafood Platter goes, it was your typical fried fish platter, nothing to rave about, even though it cost $27.\\n\\nLastly, it's to be noted that the service left much to be desired. After we had ordered our meals, we were brought a basket of bread and butter ... no silverware. There were two strips of bread in this basket: one which was soft & cut into two pieces and the other one which was not cut & quite hard. We didn't receive any silverware the first time we asked & had to ask again. The waiters caused some commotion at a table nearby after someone had dropped a water cup made of glass on the floor. None of them seemed very on top or quick about getting it cleaned up.\\n\\nWe did round out the evening by getting the bread pudding for dessert (our servers suggestion) & this $5 dessert was probably the best thing we had all evening! Overall, I'd say that if it was worth the money, I would go back to Pappadeaux's for the salmon; based on this experience, however, it's not likely that we'll be going back.", "beginning": "Highly disappointed with our dining experience last night.

{"trgt": "We just got back from a 4 night stay at the Cosmopolitan and I doubt I'll go back.  This hotel fell well short of our expectations.  In short, our room wasn't ready when we arrived, items in our room didn't work, the room had been and continued to be poorly cleaned during our stay, and hotel staff was in general not helpful.\\n\\nUpon arrival, we were informed that they didn't have any rooms available like we reserved and that they didn't know how long it would be before one would be ready.  They tried to up-sell us to another room for $50/night, but we declined and chose to wait for the room we requested to be cleaned and become available.  They gave us keys and informed us that they would call shortly and let us know what our room number is and that our keys would be automatically activated for that room.  After roughly a 2 hour wait, we received the call that our room was ready, but their system to activate the keys wasn't working so we needed to go back to the front desk to get new keys made.  After getting back to the front desk to get new keys made, another attempt was made by the front desk employee to up-sell us to a different room, this time for $30/night.  Again we declined.  However, we were able to talk them into putting us in a room on a higher floor than what they had originally assigned us to (originally assigned us to a room on the 30th floor and we ended up with a room on the 61st floor).\\n\\nAt first glance the room was nice, but the longer we stayed there, the more issues we found.  We found an empty beer can in one of the cabinets within the first 30 seconds of entering the room, but yet the maid didn't seem to be able to find it and dispose of it in the 4 days we stayed there.  The mini bar was missing items.  We worried that this would show up on our bill when we checked out.  It did, but the front desk had no issue taking the item off our bill.  The lights in the room can all be controlled via on/off wall switches or via dimming options through the TV.  It's kind of a neat system except it rarely worked.  After our first night, we were never able to control the lights or any of the other features in the room using the TV.  We were also never able to get the TV in the living room area to come on after the first day.  I suspect the 2 issues were related.  The jacuzzi features in the bath tub didn't work at all.  The maid seemed to come every day we were there, but yet I saw no signs that the room was ever vacuumed while we were there.  The iron in the room had a broken knob on it so you couldn't tell what setting it was on or change the setting.  My other issues with the room get pickier from there so I'll stop.  While this all sounds bad, we didn't stress out about it too much as we really didn't spend that much time in the room to begin with.\\n\\nThe staff at the Cosmopolitan leaves much to be desired as well.  Of the 3 people we had to deal with at the front desk, only 1 was really helpful and pleasant to talk to.  It ended up working out better for us that this didn't happen, but when the front desk called us to tell us our room was ready, they should have also called the bellhop for us to have our bags that we left with them brought up to our room.  Instead, we had to stand in line and deal with the bellhop ourselves.  We rented a car for a day from the Hertz desk inside the hotel.  Upon trying to return the car, no one was working the desk at 11am.  The couple in line in front of us at the Hertz desk waited nearly 35min while hotel staff was dumbfounded as to why someone wasn't working the desk.  We waited about 20min and a couple behind us waited about 10min.  I can't fault the hotel too much for Hertz not doing their job, but the organization and communication among the hotel staff about how to resolve the situation was pathetic.\\n\\nMy girlfriend had ordered a b-day cake from the hotel to be delivered to the room at a specific time and day to surprise me.  This request was confirmed multiple times and the hotel assured her that the cake would be delivered to the room at the time she request.  But, of course, the cake was in fact not delivered at the time she asked for nor anywhere close to the time she asked for.  We don't actually know when it was delivered because we had to leave to make a dinner reservation.  When we returned to the room much later that evening, the cake was sitting there in the room.  No apology or explanation was ever given as to why the cake wasn't delivered when requested.\\n\\nWhile there wasn't any one big incident that really made us dislike our stay at the Cosmopolitan, it was the numerous little things that, at the end of our stay, made us look back and wonder if maybe we should have stayed at a different hotel.  I truly expected more from this Hotel.

{"trgt": "I have driven by Flame Kabob countless times in the course of dropping packages off at USPS, but the timing just hadn't worked out.  Last night, we were heading out to drop off some packages and were looking for somewhere to eat afterwards.   I pulled up Restaurant.com and found a $25 off $35 for Flame Kabob - just what I was looking for!\\nThe restaurant is well-lit, stands out on the corner of its building, and is spacious.  The design is...  let's use \\\"eclectic\\\".  Assorted granite tabletops and faux rock wall decor lend to a Mediterranean feel, as do the bumpin' beats laid behind sultry \\\"Arabic\\\" vocals (I barely speak Spanish) playing overhead (at an interestingly reasonable volume).  \\n\\nOn the large Flatscreen TV which manages to not look TOO out of place, CNN aka The Anderson Cooper Network was broadcasting news of the Libyan uprising.  It strangely juxtaposed with the music, making me wish all news were Autotuned for our enjoyment.\\n\\nThe help was... well, helplful if not all that personable.  He seemed a bit irritated with us although we were the only people in the store and still ended up spending $40 for 3 people (after coupon, but also after the 18% grat was added, which wasn't really a grat, but just more income for the restaurant... meh.)\\n\\nOn to the food:\\n\\nWe ordered Hummus ($2.49), Baba Ghanoush ($1.99), Tabouli ($1.99), and uhh... the yogurt and cucmber sauce/dip (Mast-O-Khiar - $2.49) along with some extra bread ($1.99) to start .  Our \\\"appetizers\\\" came up within about 8-10 minutes and we were off to the races, stuffing our face with as much deliciousness as we could, and it was all delicious!  The hummus had great flavor, and I actually ate Baba Ghanoush and Tabouli, neither of which I normally ever touch.  Even the bread itself was notably tasty, a rare treat and much appreciated!\\n\\nThe main courses were (we all shared):\\nGround Beef Kabob plate ($6.99)\\nGround Chicken Kabob plate ($6.99)\\nGround Lamb Kabob plate ($7.99)\\nTenderloin Chicken Kabob plate ($8.99)\\n\\nALL came with a giant pita (half of a 12\\\"), tons of what they underwhelmingly call \\\"Saffron Rice\\\" (which is actually some of the most attractive, subtly flavorful, and well-cooked rice I've ever had... there's got to be a name for that!  \\\"Wicked Awesome Rice\\\", perhaps?)\\n\\nBoth chicken plates got gobbled up before anyone could discuss  how they'd be divided (Fork Wars!)  On to the beef, which was perfectly seasoned (not OVERseasoned as is alllll too common in Mediterranean places).  Everything was tender, perfectly cooked, and seriously - I can't say enough about their getting the seasoning right.  Finally, a place that doesn't think \\\"Brian needs another cup of salt in him!\\\"\\n\\nIt was late in the day, so I'm going light on the lamb... Yes, Lamb is gamey, but done right and perfectly fresh, it's not as gamey as what I ate (I had to eat most of it - I'm our \\\"garbage disposal\\\"... \\n\\nAfter fulfilling my disposal duties (the lamb wasn't THAT bad... just full of lamb-y flavor!),  on came the dessert - Baklava ($1.99).\\n\\nHow good was it?  We bought phyllo dough, butter, pistachios and honey before we got home after being reminded just how much Baklava can DRIP WITH DELICIOUSNESS!!!  Yes, I licked the honey out of the container - what about it!?\\n\\nFor our $10 tip, we didn't really get any \\\"service\\\", but this isn't that type of place... the open kitchen (awesome) was quick to let us know when our food was up (also awesome).  We considered leaving our disposable everything on the table but opted to haul it to the trash ourselved (darned morals - although we did leave a good bit of rice on the table). \\n\\nOn the way out, we walked past a few bags of trash which hadn't made their way to the dumpster just yet... Nothing \\\"shocking\\\", it was late, they were nearing closing, but really... you can't just take the extra steps to the dumpster when almost no one's in the restaurant?\\n\\nOverall, great place, good specials (not available with Restaurant.com coupon), a little in the middle of nowhere but if you're on Sunset by the \\nairport, there's few places to eat and this is a reaaaally good one.  \\n\\nTheir full menu is on their home page (awesome, and a rare treat... I don't care about your atmosphere and blahhhh.

The room was so dusty my boyfriend's asthma was set off within the first 10 minutes. Not only that, but there were hair curlers in the bed, the shower door was broken and the lamp next to the bed has EXPOSED WIRING! We called and req. our room be cleaned and to speak with a manager. The first time I was hung up on, and then they transferred me to the incorrect line, and then I just got the voicemail of someone who never called me back. I wasn't screaming and yelling I was very calm but I was definitely upset. This was a family trip, and all we wanted to do was spend time with our family but instead we had to wait for the maids and the engineer to come and get our room up to par. Also, the lobby smells like a moldy ashtray, and the chicken alfredo at the Tuscany Garden Italian restaurant just tasted like thick warm milk. Three of us had it and we didn't eat it.

I get massages 3times a week at least(not here). This was by far the worst massage ive ever had and i had hundreds of different people work on me.

We purposely arrived about an hour near closing because I figured that the lines wouldn't be as bad then.  I was right, only waited about 20 minutes to get into our seats.  Overall service was great and for that I cannot complain.  I feel the ambiance and the decor.  I even love their tables and wish I had that pattern at home.  But this review is about the food, right? \\n\\nIn my opinion, if you've been to one buffet in Las Vegas, you've been to them all.  The dishes here are served in mini-portions, which I think is great for pictures.  But lousy for a buffet.  When I think buffet, I think as much as I want.  Give their Fried Chicken Wings as an example.  You get two pieces presented in a cute stainless steel strainer.  But if I wanted 6 pieces, I would have to grab 3 of these bad boys, really? How about their Angry Mac N' Cheese.  The portions are small and if I wanted a little more, than I'm grabbing multiple tins of these.  Again, great for photos, but not convenient for eating.  This is pretty much the experience with all their mini-dishest.  By the time I was done, I've tried their fried chicken, roasted chicken, salmon, sushi (don't do it), mac n cheese, and their garlic pizza.  All were just about par with every one else on the strip.  Not bad in taste, not the greatest either.  \\n\\nNow for dessert...This is where Wicked Spoon has their one shining moment.  It's all about desserts here.  From presentation to taste, you really can't go wrong with their desserts. Their macarons weren't that great, but everything else disappeared once it made it to my table.  \\n\\nOverall, I have to give Wicked Spoon just 3 stars because it's just okay compared to the rest of the strip buffets out there.

As mentioned above, the Trinity of restaurant experience of ambiance, food and service are necessary for good experience; however, if one is missing, and drastically missing here, experience is just marred.\\n\\nWe took a seat on the patio and were not greeted for 15 min. yes 15 full minutes sitting alone like hobo Joes.

Almost zombielike, probably just hung over. In fact all the service staff that I viewed seem to have this zombielike hangover.\\n\\nAnyhow, I asked her about the bloody Mary's and they were good as I assume they should be a roadhouse and she said, \\\"the other awesome this bartender makes a really good.\\\" I smiled and happily agreed and waited in anticipation for this bloody Mary of greatness.

Still no bloody Mary.\\n\\nWhen the bloody Mary did arrive we have been seated for about 27 min. yes 27 min. to get a drink. What's more disappointing is how awful the drink was. I'm not particularly picky as I felt you can't really mess up a bloody Mary but they sure did. Came out in a small plastic tumbler glass and literally tasted like tomato juice with barely any spice in it and no garnish whatsoever. It looked really sad and tasted sad. What really pissed me off was about 15 feet away there was a couple of guys seating at the bar who have bloody Mary's in glass pint glasses with a salted rim and a bunch of garnishes with some celery stalk and you can see from the color of the drink that it was made like a bloody Mary. REALLY!! It really sucks and I totally felt cheated. Restaurants without consistency drive me crazy. A Big Mac in Boston is the same as a Big Mac in San Diego. Your drinks and food should be the same. \\n\\nThe food runner or cook came to our table with an appetizer of sliders and said, \\\"your sliders.\\\" I told him that we an order that that we ordered shrimp and he said, \\\"what you mean?\\\" I found that almost comical statement as it reiterated to him that we had ordered shrimp not sliders. About 5 min. later shrimp came out. This is where I have a hard time deciphering between two and three stars for this place because the food is really good. The Cajun shrimp drunken appetizer was outstanding. I even thought of ordering one to go for later on.\\n\\nI had a Rubin and my mom had meatloaf. My mom's diabetic and can have a lot of sugar and the meatloaf came out with huge blobs of barbecue sauce on it. I'm not sure that was my mistake and I didn't read the menu correctly but I don't think I would have missed that. Anyhow we scraped off the barbecue sauce and my mom absolutely love smoky flavored meatloaf she commented about three times how good it was. My Reuben sandwich also was very good with an ample stacking of meat which I appreciated. Coleslaw was obviously fresh and had a good flavor but lacked the will of the seasoning and punch. Again food was outstanding. No doubt about that.\\n\\nAfter the appetizer was served I had seen that they have Corona light on tap so I ordered one. 20 min. to get a beer and I was nearly finished with my meal when it came.

It came with a side of mashed potatoes and gravy which was good enough, nothing special, but only had two bites in it, and two very small but scrumptious biscuits with honey. Dear Kristen had the shaved prime rib dip which was fine, a little disappointing I guess, just not much meat, the meat to bread ratio was severely lacking, and it came with fries which were very good. If you're really in the mood for a prime rib sandwich, head to Houston's. \\n      I will be back here for sure.

Perhaps because the weather was gross or that we came smack in the middle of the afternoon, Bang Bang was really quiet. It gave me a chance to appreciate their decor and choice of music (Sinatra was on). It's a nice, cozy place with a warm interior. I dig that. \\n\\nWe tried the cheeseburger eggrolls, the Hangover with regular fries, and the Brie burger with sweet potato fries. We were really surprised at how well the cheeseburger eggrolls turned out. My only advise there is to make sure you order enough and wait a moment for them to cool. Hubs had the Hangover burger and let me try a bite. I liked it. I wish it just had a couple pieces of crispy whole bacon to round it off. My Brie burger was awesome. The tomato jam was sweet and mellow which really complements the brie and arugula. Normally I don't dig big wads of greens on my burger, but this stack was well balanced and tender, so it was pleasant. I think my one regret was getting a single because the Duke's Bread buns are a little too bulky to carry just one patty. Then again, I couldn't even finish my food (which is saying a lot considering I'm a fluffy girl in the Gabriel Iglesias sense), so that's probably more reflective of the bun just being too big. All these were good.......but the sweet potato fries with maple sauce....those were great. I can't really pin down why the sauce is so perfect. It's sweet, but it's not frosting sweet. It's tangy, but not ketchup tangy. Ugh, IDK, but it's delicious with the salted sweet potato fries. The regular fries are top notch too, but getting great regular fries has really become a standard expectation these days. I like that this place offers so many healthy options too. It makes feeding a mixed palate group much easier (though you won't catch me wolfing down broccoli with garlic oil any time soon; in fact, that's the only thing GHWB and I agree on politically: no broccoli. I don't like it.

The potatoes are cooked to perfection - crispy on the outside and fluffy and light on the inside - just how a baked potato should be, but so few places manage to get it right.\\n\\nRotato admittedly, have one downfall - it only has a selection of 7 fillings for your potatoes, but these fillings are simply sublime - well thought out, stunningly tasty and sometimes even odd combinations that work so well its a suprise you have never though of it before. There are being new fillings added to the menu all the time, but the ones that are available now are absolutly perfect. Having tried the entire menu now, I would suggest going for the adventurous sounding 'Aussie Mongrel' - chilli, coleslaw, cheese and sour cream. Mmmmmm.\\n\\nI love this place, I really do, and I wish that Yelp could give some sort of extra special sixth star - this place deserves it!", "beginning": "Possibly the best name for a shop ever, Rotato delivers", "mgt": "\"Possibly the best name for a shop ever, Rotato delivers an exceptional experience for anyone who loves unique kitchen gadgets.

{"trgt": "Some people are going to view this as a one star hotel and others are going to view it as a five star... it's all about what you are looking for.\\n\\n1 star... if you are looking for any semblance of the typical Las Vegas experience.\\n\\n5 star... if you don't want to be anywhere near the action, are looking for a relaxed location and spot, and are probably there with your family.\\n\\nNormally I would rate something for being what it is, but the problem in this case is false advertising that gets people here when it's not exactly what they are looking for (at least in our case).\\n\\nFor starters, \\\"on the Las Vegas Strip\\\" in the name of the hotel itself is pretty misleading.  This is a LOOSE definition of the word strip because it's about as far as you can get from the main strip and still be on the strip.  I'd say it was 5 miles to the Venetian / Bellagio etc area.   Sure, we should have done our due diligence and researched this, but my sister had seen one of the locations which was closer to the center of the strip and assumed it was that one when she booked it, not knowing there are 5 different Hilton properties in and around the strip.\\n\\nThey told her she was getting a very special discounted rate for attending a timeshare presentation, but upon checking the advertised rates, it was about the same. Also, the rates weren't any cheaper than the rest of the strip for that weekend, so it's not like we were getting a discount for being far from the action either.\\n\\nThis really got me.. you have to PAY for parking every day.. and the parking lot is not exactly attached to the hotel. The first 4-5 levels are reserved for valet and are totally empty, so it's a bit annoying having to circle around and around empty spaces to get to ones you can park in.  One of the things about Vegas is free parking everywhere, but such is not the case here.\\n\\nNo Casino / Smoke, etc.. points plus for this.\\n\\nGym - Okay, normally people in Vegas don't exactly make it to the gym. But the types of people that stay somewhere like this are the types that are going to go to  the gym... so there should be more than 4 elliptical machines.  Waiting in line for an hour was not ideal. The gym is WAY too small for the capacity.\\n\\nThe walls are pretty thin and we could hear whatever the people next door were watching on TV at all hours.\\n\\nWe called down for more blankets, more toiletries and a toothbrush, and had a blanket thrown in our room with no other stuff.  Literally.. they knocked on the door and we were in bed and getting up to go answer it when we heard the door fly open, the blanket be thrown in, and the door slammed shut.

But what was not excusable was the MESS (also mentioned in another review, barista area was filthy, covered in spills. It didn't seem like anyone was worried about cleaning up either.) and the HORRIBLE customer service. Curtis was making our drinks, and he clearly can not handle a stressful situation, which probably means he shouldn't be working at Starbucks; but that's beyond the point.

As the drinks came up (slowly) I started grabbing them to get them out of the way, and as I grabbed a drink, Curtis shouted rudely, \\\"YOUR WELCOME.\\\" with a roll of the eyes. I then went up for the last drink, and asked if we could get a drink carrier; instead of making any eye contact, Curtis sighed, and shouted \\\"NOW WE NEED A DRINK CARRIER, CAN SOMEONE GET IT.\\\" a manager shouts back that they are out, so he turns to us and shrugs his shoulders while saying \\\" We're out.\\\" Thankfully a manager offered us a box, because clearly Curtis wasn't concerned.

{"trgt": "I've never had such a heartbreaking experience in my life with any store/restaurant/customer service establishment.  I'm not even a yelp kind of person, but I'm writing this review, my first ever, in hopes I save even one person from the stress this store has put on me.\\n\\nI'm my best friend's maid of honor and she chose to purchase her wedding dress and have her bridesmaids buy their dresses through this store.  It just so happens that my brother is also getting married, and using the same bridesmaid dress designer as my friend, so I figured I could kill two birds with one stone and order both dresses through Lillian Lottie.  From the beginning my experience was horrible.  Though there were a few saleswomen who were quite kind and competent over the phone (I do not live in Phoenix, so my transactions were all over the phone), the majority have no idea what they are doing.  Most times I called I would be put on hold til I was eventually hung up on, put through to the wrong person, or told that the salesperson was unavailable and would return my call. (Obviously I understand that a client in store is more important than a phonecall, so returning my call seems totally reasonable. But she never took down my name/number.  ...That info is kind of essential to return a call, isn't it?)\\n\\nNext problem: the ordering of the dresses.  I will spare the long-winded details of this next part, but in a nutshell, my dresses were both tremendously too large.  I understand that bridal sizes are different than street clothes, but considering the fact that my measurements were sent to them from a tailor, and that the designer of the dress had a website that said my measurements should have equalled a 10, I found it quite odd that they were insisting on my purchasing a 14.  Listening to the woman on the phone, I agreed.  Huge mistake.  The dresses showed up at my door and when I tried them on I looked like a lady on the cover of People magazine wearing her clothes after she had lost 100lbs.  I called Lillian Lottie devastated begging for a return and reorder, and they said it was too late, there was nothing they could do, and that they stood by their size chart. The designer couldn't possibly make a new one in time. \\nTurns out every single other bridesmaid had the same issue with their dresses. (Though none as severe as mine, and unfortunately none of them had purchased TWO dresses.) After much stress on the sweet bride (who eventually removed her purchased wedding dress from Lillian Lottie and took it to be tailored at another place... oh, did I mention they originally ordered her the wrong dress? I suppose I will save that for her yelp post...) we managed to get a little bit of money back from Lillian Lottie for the alterations.  They even admitted that they messed up with my sizes specifically.  So I took the two dresses to a local, well-respected tailor and awaited the alterations.  Today I picked up my dresses...\\n\\n...They look horrible. The tailor did a beautiful job working with what she could.  She basically had to recreate the two gowns, but there was nothing much she could do... they look like completely different dresses.  I'm so upset with Lillian Lottie because rather than just admitting from the beginning that they may have miscalculated sizing they could have returned the dresses to the designer and get a smaller size.  Instead they were too bent on being \\\"right\\\" and said there wouldn't have been enough time.  (I even contacted a higher up from the actual dress designer, and they were appalled that Lillian Lottie claimed it couldn't be done at the time this first issue with Lillian Lottie occurred.)\\n\\nMy best friend's wedding next week.  The dress looks disgusting, but it is what it is.  My brother's wedding is in October, so I'm hoping I can work with the designer and figure something out.  It may seem odd that though this debacle has been going on for several months, that I'm only posting this now.  However picking the dresses up from the tailor today and looking at the dresses hanging next to me right now,  knowing that it is over $500 worth of dresses that I will never wear again is enraging.  They should pay for both of these dresses.  But they won't.  They have my money and I'm out of their hair, so why would they?  So basically I'm writing this post to warn you ladies out there... do not shop at this establishment.\\n\\nWorst part is I'm engaged. I'm having a humongous wedding in Phoenix in May.  I have yet to buy my dress or choose the bridesmaids dresses.  Not only will I be taking my business elsewhere, I will make it a priority to inform any one I can to never shop at this place.\\n\\nTo Lillian Lottie:  I expected more. You seemed to have class.  Sadly, I was proven otherwise and unfortunately I'm the only one suffering from it.  Two dresses and over $500 down the drain.  And please don't respond with a snarky comment, Lillian Lottie, why I'm wrong and you're right.  I've noticed you do that, and it's unbecoming.", "beginning": "I've never had such a heartbreaking experience in my life", "mgt": "\"I've never had such a heartbreaking experience in my life.

{"trgt": "I like this hotel but I don't love it as my stay was nice but I don't think I'd stay here again. Not that there's anything particularly wrong with this Trump hotel, it just doesn't feel like it should be in Las Vegas.\\n\\nThe location is a couple of blocks off the Strip which can be a good or a bad thing, depending on what you want from your stay in Vegas. Its easy to drive elsewhere if you have a car, and a cab ride will cost $15-20 to the farthest reaches of the strip like the Mandalay Bay, and much less for hotels that are closer. \\n\\nFor those with a car this hotel has valet only, although it is free (included in the resort fee). The valet staff was hard-working and was always friendly and professional on both drop-off and pickup.\\n\\nThis is also a non-smoking resort, although there were a few people smoking in the pool area (wtf). \\n\\nThe pool was OK but nothing to write home about. Lounge chairs were plentiful and comfortable, but the pool only went 4ft. deep, kinda lame for someone well over 6ft. tall. There were also two hot tubs, one on either side of the pool, but they close at 6pm (another wtf). The final wtf is for them playing loud, annoying, radio music over speakers that are placed so far apart that it sounds like you are listening to the same song twice, only one of them is playing a half second after the other. For me pools are for relaxing, not for partying, but I could see others differing form my opinion.\\n\\nThere is only one restaurant in this hotel and I didn't have a chance to try it. The menu looked like standard American hotel cuisine (boring) so I ventured out to other hotels and also away from the Strip to satisfy my culinary urges. \\n\\nThe lounge next to the restaurant is only open until Midnight on Sundays. Not sure about other days.\\n\\nFinally, the rooms were very good but with a few downsides. I stayed in the basic room (forget the actual name of the suite but it was the lowest priced room). It was indeed huge and well appointed with a well-sized water closet (walk-in shower), separated toilet closet, dual-vanity sink, and large jacuzzi tub. Everything in the bathroom was great except the shower head had some crust on it and could have used a second shower head, or just a better shower head that had a bigger coverage area (again, I'm a large human and so I prefer a shower that covers more than a few square inches of my body at a time).\\n\\nThe bed was comfortable but not super comfortable (could have been softer). It creaked a bit as I imagine thousands of people have already had sex in it, with thousands more to do so in the future (hey, its Las Vegas). There were also a few chips on the wood bed frame and the mattress was a few inches too short for the frame. The pillows were super soft and collapsed just how I like. The sheets were also very soft.\\n\\nThe AC worked fine but there was a large paint chip on the exhaust grill. \\n\\nThe view of the strip was great, but be warned, you can still hear car traffic and police/ ambulance sirens form the street, even way up on the 59th floor. The windows were double pained but were not at all completely sound-proof like they should have or could have been. Its obvious that they cut corners when designing and/ or building this tower,\\n\\nAdditionally, some airplanes taking off from the McCarren turn and fly directly overhead Trump which may or may not bother you.\\n\\nRoom entrances are side by side sharing a common entrance, so its like having two doors to your room. This is a nice touch and means you can't hear any noise from the elevator or hallways. However, the doors are very heavy and SLAM shut super loud, which can be annoying. \\n\\nWi-fi is included in the resort fee. There are no safes in the room. The mini kitchen is nice too with a mini fridge that is empty and not stocked with overpriced hotel crap.\\n\\nMy final analyses is that this hotel is more suited to a regular city like New York or Chicago and that I would prefer to stay somewhere else next time I am in Las Vegas. The hotel is nice but is in no way perfect and lacks the dining variety of a Belaggio, Mandalay Bay, Venetian, etc. \\n\\nOh ya, and there is no casino at this hotel.", "beginning": "I like this hotel but I don't love it as", "mgt": "\"I like this hotel but I don't love it as much as I hoped.

{"trgt": "We rolled up to the state fair on a fine Sunday afternoon.

I discovered that I am not a big fan of deep fried sweets.  Maybe I'm just not in the right space for it, but most of the food options at the Fair looked uniformly gross.  Nickels went gaga over the bunny rabbits while I had a staring contest with a turkey.  Man turkeys are a lot of ugly to pack into one bird.

The bar area is probably not the most popular spot in the whole restaurant, because it only sits like 10 patrons, but we took a chance. Our bartender was a little strange.

More of something I've had on satay. \\n\\nThey used dry red pepper in the sauce which is fine for the paste but it lowers the hot spice flavor. Using oil or fresh red pepper will fix that fast. In addition to the dried pepper I ordered it at a 7 spice level but personally it felt like a 4 or 5 tops. I do not eat spicy food often so my tolerance is not high. \\n\\nThe better dish -- my boyfriend's pumpkin tofu curry was a better bet and really I think Nicky's pleases better with its non traditional dishes.

{"trgt": "Well, I must say I was quite impressed with this place. It almost got a four star rating from me, and that's VERY rare. As always, I checked up on Yelp and also the Maricopa County health inspections site to make sure this place wasn't a liability waiting to happen to my stomach. Seemed quite legit from what I read, so I joined in with group of workmates for lunch yesterday. The parking spots out the front are absolutely ridiculous and appear impossible to park a car in - if you had a regular sedan in one of the spaces, its butt would literally be on the sidewalk and about a half yard from the kerb. Just plain weird. So we parked around the corner in front of a minimart and walked back. Interior is nice and clean, I was sort of expecting it to be more on the dingy side. It's one of those place-order-at-counter-and-they-bring-it-to-your-table places. Fairly limited menu, but then again it's a cheesesteak joint, not Claim Jumper.\\n\\nI ordered the Coronado minus the peppers. Plenty of the items appear to have jalapenos or habaneros, and once upon a time that'd have been just fine with me, but I've softened over the years. I got a side of fries and a drink. The food took a while to be made; not too long, maybe about 15 mins? They certainly didn't seem to be goofing off in the kitchen though. Out came the food and I was very pleasantly surprised. I'm not one of these wankers who walk in already predisposed against a place, ready to start judging how sh1t is done in \\\"Philly\\\" or \\\"Chicago\\\" and who wind up missing the point completely (see my highly-rated review of the now-closed Frank-N-Steins in Surprise for more rage on this subject *8-), I was simply there to have a good meal. And I sure got one. The food was delicious.. bread was soft and fresh, meat was tender as hell and the chilli mayo was pretty much all world. I haven't had a sandwich that tasty in.. well, in about a week, actually, since I had an All-American Grinder at Uncle Sams. Shoestring fries were pretty good too. Uncle Sams' are better. I'm not really a \\\"crisp fries\\\" guy, but.. these were good.\\n\\nThe only thing bringing my rating down to the usual average is the price. My whole sandwich was $9.75 plus tax. And an additional $2.50 for the fries and drink. That's just a little too expensive for lunch. I've had burritos as big as my forearm packing just as much flavour for $5.95, and while I get the whole \\\"it's super delightful, ultra-quality, hand-chopped ribeye\\\" thing, ten bucks for a mid-sized hoagie regardless of whether or not it contains sauteed unicorn nuts is too steep to make me want to return as frequently as I otherwise would. Weird how a half is $8 and a whole is a buck senny five more. Seems almost like movie popcorn pricing to me.\\n\\nDon't get me wrong, this was probably the best cheesesteak I've ever eaten and everyone I was with agreed, and it's a surprisingly neat little establishment where you might actually want take out-of-town tie-wearers for lunch, but it's just a tad on the pricey side IMO.", "beginning": "Well, I must say I was quite impressed with this", "mgt": "Well, I must say I was quite impressed with this product.

I've actually never had this happen before.\\n\\nMaybe my illustration didn't fully justify how RUDE AND ARROGANT he was but we were completely disgusted.

When I arrived the restaurant wasn't packed, but there was a few people and no line.  \\n\\nI really struggled to give this place 4 stars.  The reason was because the girl at the counter was really rude.  This was the first time I have ever been here and was asking some questions.  She seemed annoyed and just wanted to take my order.  I was upset because there wasn't anybody behind me.  After asking a few questions I finally gave up and realized she was visibly upset.  I though maybe I caught her on an off day or she just had a rush.  Oh well, there's really no excuse to be rude.  \\n\\nIn case you were wondering I was asking about the Jay Cutler bowl.  This bowl looked like a man's bowl of food.  It was huge!  I will have to order it someday.  \\n\\nI ended up ordering the small bowl because I didn't want a big lunch.  It was priced pretty well.  and it had vegetables.  I am amazed that the other places charge you for vegetables.  Really?

The place had been other restaurants before and other than some cheesy Greek mural nothing was done. The table I was at felt like it had never been scrubbed and the benches and chairs are worn out.\\n\\nThe service was inexcusably bad, and the waitress didn't wash her hands. I know this because I followed her through the front door and never saw her wash her hands. At least until after she brought drinks she was never out of sight. She was also not very knowledgable of the menu, I asked \\\"what is in your Greek salad?\\\" And she says generic 'you know, lettuce and feta cheese and stuff' and then launches into an explanation of feta cheese. I had to ask her 2 more times before I could even get a real answer. She never offered up any specials, but when asked she told us, but one in particular was a \\\"beef casserole\\\" and \\\"they put seasonings in it to be delicious\\\" but nothing more. Ugh she was just lousy, had no table presence and did not own her role in the customer-server relationship. \\n\\nThe food was...eh, ok. Barely. Nothing tasted fresh at all.  It is still the summer and the tomatoes were lousy. The tzatziki sauce was just yogurt, no pepper or cucumber was discernible. The pita was tasteless and closing in on stale. The lamb meat was so overwhelmingly seasoned with oregano and something else I couldn't taste the lamb, but at least it was hot.  And the \\\"Greek fries\\\" were a joke. You can't sprinkle a minuscule amount of dried oregano on fries and call them Greek. \\n\\nOh and the kids meals were a let down. A healthy pile of meat on a pita, no sauce, no tomato, nothing. Nobody wants a dry gyro, not even kids.\\n\\n2 stars instead if 1 for 2 reasons. Even though the kids meal gyro was lousy it was still a great value and once we got some sauce they were edible.

Cucumber was not even marinated. Any Chinese person could've made a much better version than that. $6 for tiny 5 pieces of octopus and 1/4 of a cucumber?

If you buy frozen leek dumplings from Korean supermarket for your restaurant, at least don't advertise it as \\\"recommendation item\\\". Japanese don't eat leek. Koreans do. $6 for 5 frozen dumplings for what I can buy the entire bag of them.

Now keep in mind the sign's a bit misleading- the first thing that catches your eye says 'bento box.' Not Fresh Wasabi. But you know, I'm always down for Japanese food. The place had a decent amount of people in it, and perusing the menu I saw two things that immediately caught my eye- ramen and bulgogi. I love the former, my husband the latter. So why not? I order me some ramen, get him the bulgogi bowl, and get us a cali roll to enjoy as well. \\n\\nThe food came out promptly. That was... really about the only good thing here on out. \\n\\nMy biggest beef (no pun intended) was how they packaged my ramen. They kept the broth and the noodles in two separate Styrofoam bowls. Pretty standard procedure. But they they proceed to stack my noodles and broth, my husband's bulgogi bowl AND the cali roll one on top of the other in some precarious leaning tower of take out asian food. It was a disaster waiting to happen. But I totter out with this tower of food tied up in a plastic bag, and proceed to drive the 5 or so miles home as carefully as I could. \\n\\nNo luck. The thing topples over at the first light I gently pull to a stop at, and by the time I get home and bring the plastic bag in I realize that my broth is no longer in my styrofoam bowl, but all over the bottom of the plastic bag. \\n\\nThank god for good plastic bags. At least they invested in those, because the lids on the soup bowl sure weren't up to par. The weight of everything else on top of the broth bowl broke the lid, and the braking did the rest. Soup got into our cali rolls, but NOT my noodles. My husband's bulgogi bowl escaped largely unscathed, but that didn't save it. It was bland and not very much like bulgogi. The cali roll was also, even without being soggy, mediocre and bland. And the mayo in the krab-mayo mix was yellow. Why, oh why? \\n\\nNow I'll take credit where credit's due.

{"trgt": "I had been taking my two poodles here for grooming for a few years and was always happy with the service. Miriam would always groom at least one of them and was so good with my one dog who has arthritis in his hips and has sensitivity on his stomach area from being attacked and chewed up by a much larger dog.\\n\\nI will be honest and say that my dogs are not the easiest to groom.  The younger one likes to jump around the table and I guess Miriam said he does nip on occasion, which shocked me because I always tell people he wouldn't hurt a fly.  My other older poodle with the issues just needs to be picked up and handled properly and he is fine. With that being said, they have always been able to fully groom them and they have always left looking great. Miriam was always so happy to see them when they came in.\\n\\nRecently Miriam moved, so when my boys needed a grooming we just dropped them off with whoever was available. I dont know what happened but when my husband went to pick them up the groomer ( who was a young male, probably Miriams replacement) pretty much told off my husband saying that our dogs are \\\"bad dogs\\\" and that they dont do \\\"bad dogs\\\" there. He kept repeating over and over how our dogs are \\\"bad dogs.\\\"  My one poodle with all of the problems didn't even get his head groomed.  He left there looking the way he did when we brought him in. \\n\\nIn my opinion when you sign up to be a dog groomer you should be prepared to deal with difficult dogs.  I mean, what dog likes to be scrubbed down in a bath, shaved, paws and ears trimmed, nails clipped, etc?\\n\\nWe were never told by Miriam or any other groomer who did them that they were \\\"bad dogs.\\\" I was highly offended by his attitude and lack of professionalism.  I am pretty sure this guy must have been new because I had never seen a male groomer there before.  I'm not sure if maybe he was not handling them properly or just did not have the patience, but I would have appreciated him handling the situation better. \\n\\nI am very disappointed and  will not be returning to Bone Appetit because of this incident.", "beginning": "I had been taking my two poodles here for grooming", "mgt": "\"I had been taking my two poodles here for grooming, and I couldn't be happier with the results.

{"trgt": "This place was crazy. We thought at first that the staff must be a bunch of college students that just started working a week ago, but after reading the other reviews, I'm not sure this is true! I think one major issue is that there is team service and thus no one individual waiter was responsible for our table. \\n\\nThere was one waiter (blond, short) who seemed to be in charge. He spent most of our visit appearing baffled. I watched him at the register station trying to write up bills and use the register. Comical. It took 15 minutes for them to visit our table after we were seated. After that the food came out at a nice pace - first some appetizer type things, then the steamed dumpling appetizer we ordered, and our entrees. \\n\\nThe food was fine. I am not a Korean food connoisseur, so I can't really comment on how authentic or good it is - to our American palates, it was just ok. Also seemingly expensive, but the portions were large. \\n\\nOnce we were done eating, we started waiting. We waited, and waited and waited. The servers ignored us, and noodled around - they never actually look at the diners so it was super difficult to get anyone's attention. Finally we called a skinny waiter over, and asked for two simple things: 1) the check (which seemed to please him) and 2) take out boxes (which caused him to furrow his brow and look slightly angry). OK. \\n\\nSo this guy then continues doing random crap as if we had never asked for anything. 5-10 minutes go by while he walks back and forth to the kitchen, empty handed, and refilling water glasses (I must say, they were excellent with water service). It was as if we had never spoken to him. Finally we call the short blond waiter over and ask for 1) the check and 2) boxes. He says, oh, of course. He asks the skinny guy to get us boxes. Skinny guy rolls his eyes and says \\\"yeah, yeah, yeah\\\". Skinny guy proceeds to do other things for another 10 minutes before finally procuring two take out containers from the depths of Squirrel Hill. \\n\\nNow for the check. We waited and waited some more. Blond, short waiter looks confused but decides he needs something to do. He walks around asking how everyone's food is. He takes orders from other tables. Finally, we ask, can we *please* for the love of everything that is holy have our check? He replied incredulously, \\\"Oh! You haven't gotten your check yet?!?!?!?\\\" So if he didn't get our check, who would have gotten it? He is the check guy! OMG I didn't even know what to think. \\n\\nNeedless to say, we paid in cash to save the pain of waiting our credit card to be run. And then we ran out of the restaurant.

On the reservation, I stated we are celebrating our anniversary and hubby's birthday but the hostess didn't bother looking at the reservation and acknowledge our celebration like other restaurants did.\\n\\nAnyway...we didn't have breakfast so I did a quick glance of the menu and was ready to order. We ordered the crab cake $16), clam chowder ($9), lobster roll ($27) and the fish tacos ($17).\\n\\nThe crab cake just came by it self with some aioli sauce which I thought for $16 bucks, we should have gotten two. It was a medium size crab cake with chunks of crab but who puts pineapple in their crab cakes? I sure don't. I thought the crab cake was bland. I was hoping really bold flavors, at least with a slight kick.\\n\\nOn came the clam chowder which should have been called bacon chowder since their were more bacon bits than clams. The consistency was watery like soup rather than a chowder. The flavor certainly wasn't the taste of the oceanic clams, it was bacon and dairy (milk and creamy) and left that dairy after taste like I just had a cup of milk which I don't like.\\n\\nAfter the chowder, it seems like we were done because we waited for about 15 minutes and our entrees have not arrived yet. We waited patiently..mind you again, the restaurant wasn't busy..about only five tables were filled. The waiter finally comes over and asked if we received our entrees yet, and when we said no, he went to check and mentioned they messed up on the orders. At that point, hubby and I was already talking about canceling the rest of our orders and eating at Burger Bar. Unfortunately, when I asked if our orders were being made, hubby's fish was already on the fire so we left it at that but mine wasn't even made yet, so I was able to cancel it. Hubby's fish taco finally came and he enjoyed it but not worth $17.\\n\\nWhen the bill came, he forgot to take out the lobster roll, so he had to go correct it.

{"trgt": "I have very mixed feelings about the Mirage. Some things were great, others just OK, while some things sucked ass.\\n\\nFirst the good: The renovated rooms are very nice. Flat screen TV's plus all kinds of ports for computers, video games, and an Ipod dock. Lots of granite , very comfortable chairs, all around a tasteful, comfortable room.  Also the air-conditioning was quiet and very cool. The only complaints about the room were the cheap plastic toilet seat that wouldn't fucking stay up when I was urinating, and the shower/tub combo seemed claustrophobic and I couldn't help but get the entire floor wet when bathing. \\n\\nThe buffet was also very good, and laid out well, no bottlenecks of people standing holding their plates impatiently waiting for food (hear me Paris?) The asian items were my favorite along with huge cold crab legs. Japonais restaurant was excellent. Though expensive, the service was amazing and every single item was yummy.  \\n\\nI did have good luck in the casino on the slots, despite Mirage's reputation for having a tight casino.  I played ALIEN slots and won like $150 in a matter of seconds when I hit a bonus round and blew the alien out of the airlock.  I screamed out loud I was so happy.  I never ever win anything. That made my fucking day!!\\n\\nNow for what was bad:  Caribe Cafe--this place sucked big steaming brown loafs! The service was atrocious, the menu very limited and expensive, and the food was dog shit. All big strip casino's have a diner/coffee shop usually open 24hrs, but this place was awful in every way, even the coffee sucked!  Downscale, older places i have stayed at such the Imperial Palace, or Tropicana had better  coffee shops.  \\n\\nThere also seemed to be a lot of small technical problems which were frequent.  The card keys were stubborn and had to be inserted repeatedly EVERY SINGLE TIME I entered the room.  When I contacted the front desk they talked down to me like i had in IQ of ten.  Scripted, condescending answers and questions--\\\"Did you insert the card right? Make sure the strip is facing this way, etc. etc\\\" I also had problems with my MGM-Mirage players card having to get a new card TWICE within a four day visit. Each time the ignorant, inept employee gave me a totally different (wrong) explanation on why my card kept malfunctioning.  I hate it when places of business refuse to honestly answer questions and give scripted or made up bullshit answers.  The final demonstration of incompetence was on my final day in Vegas when I had a slot machine voucher I wanted to cash in.  The computers were down and it was impossible to cash in the voucher, even by going to a live teller instead of a machine.  Thankfully the voucher was only for $7.67 but still...\\n\\nThe only time the hotel incompetence worked in my favor was the mini bar in the room.  Me and my friends had some of the tiny liquor bottles in the mini bar and should have been been charged approximately $36.  Well, it's been over a month and no charge on my card!  Woohoo! I shoulda drank more;)\\n\\nSo, would I stay at the Mirage again? Probably not.

{"trgt": "Some people are wildly creative and enjoy putting together their own costume creation. Thankfully, for the rest of us who have no such skill set, but a desire to look good in our costumed glory, there is Showoff Costume Rentals. \\n\\nThere are countless places that pop up around Halloween with packaged costumes that look like every other costume in the Valley. They carry the same exact outfits next to the same exact accessories wall. Have you wondered were you could go to find a truly unique looking costume for an event?  Years ago, I stumbled on Showoff and have returned to them anytime I have needed a costume for an event.  \\n\\nMAKING AN APPOINTMENT: You must call ahead and make an appointment to go in. This is an important step. The shop is small so the owner, Gillian, doesn't have all of the costumes out on the floor for you to peruse. Instead you will discuss your costume idea and set up a time to get into the shop. When you arrive Gillian and/or an employee will have a number of options already set aside for you to consider. There is no better costume customer service in this town. Try getting anything like that kind of service at the pop-up shops. You simply tell Gillian what you are leaning toward and she will consider your specific theme and your size and she pull out costume options that fit your needs. \\n\\nYOUR APPOINTMENT TIME: You will show up and try on the options that they have selected. Whenever I've been there the owner has given me personal service. She looks at the costume on you, see how it fits, discusses the accessories, and helps customize the entire look. Customers don't have to worry about hanging around for hours. If you're like me, you will fall in love with the first or second option that they select for you. And the employees are right there to ring you up. No lines. \\n\\nOPTIONS: Showoff specializes in showgirl costumes.  And their selection is thorough. These are not thrown together costumes. The showgirl costumes are elegant, larger than life, and most importantly, glamorous.  I believe they are very careful with those rentals, so if you are looking for a showgirl rental, you will need to communicate with the owner. From what I've seen of their selection, there isn't any place in town with better Vegas-themes costumes But there are a wealth of other costumes available for rental: Elvis, magician, elf, cartoon character, Cleopatra, you name it. One of the best things about the costumes is the amount and quality of the accessories they include with your look. Want to be a 1920's gangster? SOC will have the suit, the weapon, the bling, the hat, and any other details necessary to give more polish to your look.  They have been dressing showgirls and other entertainers in this town for years. They take great pride in matching the customer with a costume she/he will love. This place is not trying to shove a costume at you. They want you to leave looking and feeling good about your selection. \\n\\nCOST: The costumes aren't cheap. You will be spending around $100 to rent a costume from Showoff. But you will also be walking away with a unique costume that will be detailed and eye catching.   And you may be renting the costume for a few days.  \\n\\nHALLOWEEN NOTE: As you can imagine, they are very busy during Halloween. If you want first dibs on the costumes, call and make your appointment early. \\n\\nOVERALL: Showoff Costumes has got an extensive collection of costumes and attentive customer service.  This place should be at the top of anyone's list looking for a fabulous, detail-oriented, and unique costume.", "beginning": "Some people are wildly creative and enjoy putting together their", "mgt": "own unique projects, while others prefer a more structured approach.

{"trgt": "RUDE OWNER!\\nWe have been going to Grimaldi's now Grazzianos for 10 years.  We are a family of 5 and My stepson who is 26, and husband are BIG eaters. They can easily eat enough food for a family of 6 all by themselves. Today, we walked out and vowed never to return because of the owners rude behavior. We love the wings and the happy hour specials and always support a family business over the big boys.

{"trgt": "Before I start, I must say that I'm Mexican and for the purpose of this review this does not mean anything else but: I'm proud of my food and I can be very strict with anything served as / associated with/ recognised as Mexican. Next, three facts:\\n\\n1. Burritos can be found in their natural habitat only in the north of Mexico. And not all the north, but only some states. It's a very simple snack: a flour tortilla with a bit of beans and cheese (the most traditional one). You can also find burritos with other fillings (generally two, being one either beans or cheese). That's all, no rice, no cream, no guacamole, no salsa, etc... \\n\\n2. Burritos are now a very popular fast-food snack in the US, possibly more popular in the south of the US where lots of Mexican immigrants live these days. Therefore, burritos are part of what is now known as tex-mex food. I've never tried a burrito in the US so I don't know how they are served but I presume this is where burritos took their now more popular looks and taste.\\n\\n3. Los Cardos does not intend to serve real Mexican food or Mexican real burritos. They got the idea from the Californian tex-mex burrito and offer a healthier alternative to take-away food at a reasonable price, and using fresh ingredients and good quality products. This is what the website says (go and check if you want).\\n\\nSo now I think it will be fair to say that...\\n\\nLos Cardos' \\\"interpretation\\\" and/or \\\"re-construction\\\" of burritos is a successful one and I think the success is the result of taking some common ingredients in Mexican food (beans, rice, salsa verde, coriander, cream, etc) with others not so common (like carnitas) and still leave room for the costumer's choice. Sounds like a winning formula, right? So basically, you choose the type of tortilla, the type of meat, the fillings, the salsas. How tasty your burrito will turn out to be, well... it's up to you.\\n\\nWhile I was observing how my burrito was prepared (a carnitas burrito) with all the fillings I chose (cheese, cream, beans, rice, coriander, the whole lot really) the guy explained to me about the quality of products and freshness. And yes, very fresh and well prepared. So, what they say they offer is what you'll get. By the way, very friendly staff.\\n\\nAs a take-away you're not expecting the premises to be memorable. And as I was not planning to eat my burrito there, I didn't really pay attention to where costumers could eat. I do remember very vaguely to see a couple of tables with costumers. \\n\\nI paid for my burrito a bit more than 5 pounds. A massive burrito. And I know it is a reasonable price for take-away food in the UK -and even more if good quality products are taken into account, but I still think it is rather pricy. Or perhaps I can't be objective enough (I can't help comparing prices of burritos in Mexico and they don't cost much at all... it's a snack!). Let's say that compared to other take-away snacks (kebabs, for instance), Los Cardos' burritos are probably within the price range.\\n\\nSo... Is this place good? I think it is. Is this good for Mexicans (especially the ones from the north)? Perhaps... it all depends how orthodox / flexible you are. Will I go back? If I'm in the area, quite possibly. \\n\\nBeing far from Mexico, not having \\\"my\\\" food here, has had many different interesting effects: I cook more, I've discovered markets and delis where I can find Mexican products (will write a review of Lupe Pintos soon!) but I have also learnt to appreciate other foods. To me, Los Cardos' burritos, as they say on their website, are purely inspiration. And as that, I take it... Yet, I was the most grateful Mexican when I first smelt the carnitas and a very subtle hint of orange transported me to a street market full of bright colours and music. Perhaps it was just an illusion or perhaps I was just... inspired.", "beginning": "Before I start, I must say that I'm Mexican and", "mgt": "\"Before I start, I must say that I'm Mexican and have a deep appreciation for authentic cuisine.

However, she basically took a flat brush and just kept brushing it with the blow dryer near it.  No round brush was used and she never fixed it after the cut so I had to go home and try and curl it with a brush and a curling iron.  It just looked so weirdly straight but poufy.  It was bad.\\n\\nThe cut itself was okay.  I had her cut bangs which I haven't had since I was a pre-teen.

I have never been treated this rudely anywhere but the fact that we spent that much money and they literally threw the birthday girl out the minute they closed is just really tacky and unprofessional. They shouldn't be treating anyone like this and expect to be open too long. I for one will never be back and will tell everyone I know never to go there.

My wife and mother had the chicken soup. I didn't try but they said it was so bland that they each started adding whatever salt and spices we had on the table to give it flavor.

No explanation, nothing.  Just ridiculous.   The next day was our first visit to the pool.   Very nice,  but lots of unattended wild kids.   Yes it's a free country but these kids were just nuts, running all over the place, splashing right where we were sitting. Sorry, but if I had to hear screamimg kids yell \\\"MARCO...POLO\\\" one more time I was going to lose it!  We eventually had enough and just left the pool.

So we get back to our room and the security lock bar was turned to keep the door propped open so we were a little freaked but went inside and nothing appeared to be taken.  I honeslty think after reading reviews on this site at a few places about theft issues of peoples rooms bring broken into that the housekeeping did this to allow somene else to come in and rob our room but we came back from the pool too soon (guess I SHOULD thank those unruly kids for that one).... we immediately called down to security who came up to our room and because nothing was taken that we could see, was indifferent and acted as it it was no big deal.  He said he thinks housekeeping must have accidentally did that (seriously????) Why would security even do that, cmon'....   I called down to the front desk and explained what happened and asked to speak to the manager and was put on \\\"perma-hold\\\" so eventually hung up,  I did eventually make contact with a manager (Tim I think) who was pretty indifferent about it as well.

{"trgt": "The food was good, the music was entertaining, but the service was really horrible.  The bartender was waiting our table - he forgot our food order, then brought us only part of the food we ordered, and didn't check back with us for our drinks. \\n\\nI was surprised how bad the service was, considering the rave reviews for the food.\\n\\nBeware if you order chicken by the piece.  Each piece costs $3.  Seriously, it is $3 PER PIECE for a wing, a leg, or a thigh.", "beginning": "The food was good, the music was entertaining, but the", "mgt": "service left much to be desired. Our waiter seemed overwhelmed and forgot our drink orders multiple times. It really detracted from the overall experience. While the ambiance was lively, the slow service made it hard to fully enjoy the evening. I hope they can improve this aspect in the future."}
{"trgt": "I guess I expected a lot. I had the scallops which were very good. The lobster mash was a little bland and cucumber martini I liked but it was weird and my co-worker took a sip and throught it was gross. I like weird things sometimes. Of course it was Vegas and overpriced but the scallops really were pretty perfect. However, you only get three and I am a big eater and left there kinda hungry. I don't mind spending money in Vegas but I want to leave the restaurant full.", "beginning": "I guess I expected a lot. I had the scallops", "mgt": "\"I guess I expected a lot. I had the scallops, and while they were beautifully seared, they lacked the depth of flavor I anticipated. The accompanying sauce was too subtle, almost overshadowed by the dish's presentation. I hoped for a more vibrant pairing to elevate the dish. Overall, it was a decent meal, but not quite the culinary experience I was hoping for.\""}

{"trgt": "Met a guy named Kortnei on the strip and he told us the ladies could get in free and the guys would have to pay 20 but, there would be free drinks from 10-1130.  We arrived at 10, and were greeted with VIP passes and the ladies were escorted upstairs.  Myself and 4 other male buddies went down stairs with our VIP passes and were told to stand in the General Admission line.  When we showed our passes they laughed and told us we were in the right line, and we were NOT on the guest list!!  Then, we were told that the entry was $30, and we could not get in for 40-45 minutes.  (After the free drinks).  But, the bouncer offered to get us in with a \\\"Fast Pass\\\" for another $20, so it was $50 per person to get in.  We all left disgusted!  Not for the $50, to get in which we gladly would have paid because we were there to party.  It was just the bait and switch, SHADINESS that went down.  I gave 2 stars becuse the resort is nice and we salvaged our night at the Deuce Lounge.", "beginning": "Met a guy named Kortnei on the strip and he", "mgt": "\"Met a guy named Kortnei on the strip and he instantly made the night unforgettable. His energy was contagious, and we ended up exploring hidden gems around the area. From street performances to local food stalls, every moment was filled with laughter and excitement.

I can't wait to go back and relive those memories!\""}

The homemade green salsa is really good. The steak was perfectly cooked, tender, and bursting with flavor. The eggs were fluffy and seasoned just right, making for a hearty breakfast.

The atmosphere was cozy, and the service was friendly and attentive. I can't wait to come back for more!"}
