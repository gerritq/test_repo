{"trgt": "Review for the Lounge/Club:\\nEvery time I go to Vegas this is always one of my stops- primarily because of the view. I started going years ago before it was super hyped up and packed almost all the time. I also remember the days when the Witch Doctors were twice the size they are now (and weaker than they used to be!). Voodoo hasn't changed much in the past 5 years except going cheap on the drinks and over packing the club with VIP sections that are unused (which is totally annoying if you're trying to see the view without a bunch of drunk asses running into you). \\n\\nThe DJs are consistently good and it has a very, very mixed crowd. However, I only keep coming back for the view- it doesn't compare to anything else. Ghost Bar has nothing on this place. \\n\\nAlso, over the years the award winning flair bartending has leveled off (I think I saw one bottle throw the whole time we were there) and it's not nearly the show it used to be which is really disappointing. If you ever have a chance to catch the episode of Three Sheets on Spike where Zane goes to Vegas- you'll see what I mean. The show was filmed several years ago and even there you can see the Witch Doctor and the flair are way better than they are now. \\n\\nFor newcomers I think this is a great place to at least see once just because the view is so amazing. However, for those who have been going back over and over again- it's turning into a huge disappointment. \\n\\nFor the Restaurant:\\n\\nI've dined here several times and price-wise it runs about the same as any other high end steak house you'd find on the strip. Mostly we ate here out of convenience since the selection at Rio isn't the greatest for food. The service has been reasonably decent and the food was good however, if dinner is going to cost around $100 a person I want to be wowed. The whole experience didn't seem like a 5 star dining like when we went to Strip House (wow! by the way). The servers were friendly but only slightly knowledgeable about the wine list and it seemed like there wasn't enough coverage for the tables which made dinner take forever. I don't really remember much more than that which is disappointing because I wish it were more memorable for the price paid. Been there, done that- won't be back to Voodoo Steak when there's so many better options for the same price.", "beginning": "Review for the Lounge/Club:\\nEvery time I go to Vegas this"}

{"trgt": "I went to Sole on the weekend and found that it was so crowded and noisy I thought I would wait till later.  What better night to feed my paella hungrys than tonight when it rained cats and dogs - I was seated immediately and the noise level was bearable.  I ordered a house salad, paella Valenciana, thought I might have a dessert after.  I was served a very small roll with a small piece of very cold, hard butter and waited.  The salad was better than the standard peter rabbit variety of lettuce with a slice of tomato and was not ice cold, certainly a plus.  The paella came in a traditional paella dish with, I kid you not, three small clams, three muscles, a few pieces of squid, and a few shrimp.  The rice had little saffron flavor. The Sofrito  was extremely bland with little of the spices that one associates with this dish.  Basically Sole prepares this \\\"all at once\\\" so the flavors have little or no chance to \\\"marry up\\\" and the sea food being overcooked is rubbery. In other words you must \\\"reserve\\\" the sea food and add it back in at the last moment.  As for the rice it should not be disturbed at the end of cooking so the socarrat (a crispy caramelized rice) can form in the bottom of the pan (See recipe below).  I think if you can buy canned paella and warm it up in a microwave it might be a close approximation of this abomination.  On the way out I was asked  about how I liked my meal.  When I proceeded to explain to him why I was so disappointed he ask first where I had eaten  paella and suggested that next time i should probably eat it some where else.  At no time was I rude to this person and I was frankly astonished at his attitude.  So to all you yelpers I suggest that you too might want to consider trying to find real Spanish food somewhere else.  For my friend at Sole I hope that even though he assures me that never in 8 years has he had a complaint about their  paella he will take the time next time to have the real thing at either of the fine restaurants that I have referenced in NYC.  He might also like to check out this recipe- noting the importance of the socarrat, the Sofrito, and the gradual \\\"building\\\" of the paella\\n\\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/el-charro-espanol-new-york#query:spanish%20food\\n\\nThis restaurant is a treasure and has been  serving a very special crowd for over thirty years.\\n\\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/socarrat-paella-bar-new-york\\nFor those who are not quiet as adventuresome as might be demanded by tiny little el Charro this is one of NY's best Spanish restaurants.\\n\\nhttp://www.paellapans.com/Paella-Recipe-Seafood-a/142.htm\\nThis is close to the paella that I am accustomed to eating at el-Charro's -  note the emphasis on the proper forming of the Socarrat\\n\\nRegardless of all this.

{"trgt": "Where to begin...I think I will start with the positive.   The brie brulee topped with the caramelized apple slices was a hit, the mixed green salad with goat cheese was awesome and the pear tart desert was outstanding.  The lamb shank was cooked perfectly, but the lamb flavor was missing.   The whole dish ( lamb shank, veggies, Israeli couscous, figs and apricots) ALL had the exact same flavor; only the textures were different.   Now the flavor was great, but not something I would write home about.   Now to the negative stuff...The place was too crowded and noisy for my liking. The tables were so close that I felt I could join in the conversation next to me without effort. Couple that with REALLY REALLY slow service and, well you get the idea.   You will need to bring your own wine and they will open it for you for only $10.00.  French food without wine?   really??  And then you gaff me for 10 bucks?!?  Needless to say I had the minted tea. It was okay but no real mint flavor to speak of.   The final bill for one appetizer, one salad, one entree and one desert was $70.00. (Not counting the tip)  My date and I split everything and we were comfortably well fed. So, the portion size was decent.

I will say that for a place that specializes in salads, it seemed that they could have had even more toppings to offer...no ham, no turkey, no avocado, no mozzarella, no blahblahblah... I honestly have seen more offerings at a Ruby Tuesday salad bar. \\nAs for the specially prepared salads, most people will find something tasty. I had the Caesar salad, the pineapple coleslaw, tarragon tuna something, and some chicken and rice thing. The best was the Caesar, which was especially fresh and had garlic croutons. The pineapple coleslaw was as refreshing a dish as I think I've ever had. The tuna and the chicken/rice thing was just ok to me...but I still must point out how fresh it all was. \\nThe soups were delicious. I tried the shrimp bisque and the Mexican soup (can't remember the name). The bisque was awesome as I had two bowls of it, creamy with a subtle flavor and plenty of shrimp. The Mexican soup was the meatiest thing there and had a great rustic taste. Neither soup was greasy or too heavy. \\nThe pasta was unremarkable. I had the lemon pasta with capers...all you tasted was a tang of lemon and absolutely nothing else. The pasta was well cooked, but just left you with no taste. I didn't bother with the mac and cheese, as I don't eat that at restaurants. Then there was the broccoli and cheese stuff...had too much of a twang to it, too sharp. I put it over the pasta to try and make something happen, the result was tasting nothing but the twang plus the tang. Uh uh. \\nOne of things I enjoyed the most was the asiago something something bread. It was nice and crusty, but soft somehow. And the taste was great...garlicy and the asiago cheesiness. Perfect with all the salad and even more so to sop up soup. There were other breads, but none looked as appetizing. I must say that they kept it nice and fresh, with at least 3 batches coming out while we were there. \\nDidn't try the yogurt or any of the deserts...should've. Oh well. \\nThere is also some darn good strawberry lemonade here. Its got real strawberries from the looks of it, because you can see the 'seeds' or whatever that stuff is in strawberries, all in the stuff. Either that or my glass was dirty... No, but it was great, and goes well with everything. \\nSomething else I'd like to mention is the service. The special salads had all been depleted, someone notified the cashier, the cashier immediately notified whoever, and they came over right away and began making fresh salads...which shows that there isn't some big vat in the back with premade stuff in it. The line was backing up, but the people making the salads were busting their butts. It was nice to see. \\nWill I go back? Probably not, just not my style of buffet, even though it really SHOULD replace my usual buffets. \\nShould you go? If you like salads a lot, and if you like soups a lot - then yes. Keep in mind that they only had 3 soups to choose from, and also some chili (didn't try). So that might not be enough variety for you. And you only get the pretty basic salad toppings. But its all fresh. Do not go here for the pasta. And I don't know what changes at dinner time, so maybe there's more variety then. \\nGood value? Yes, if you can get full off of salad and soup. Looking for a meal with more girth? No. $12 for no meat for a man who is looking for meat leaves a bad taste in the mouth. Don't know the prices for kids under whatever age, but there is a senior price. \\nIf you're smart enough to eat healthier, this is a decent place, but still doesn't seem to have enough stuff to choose from - that's my biggest gripe.

My other friend had the strawberry daiquiri, which she ended up returning to the bar after 2 sips.  The bartender was nice enough to change it to a better tasting drink that's on the rocks instead of being frozen.  I don't really know whether to recommend this place to a friend, I guess I will if it's their first time.  Otherwise, I probably won't go up to skybar.

{"trgt": "Ice Pan is an interesting take on an already saturated chilled dessert market. The iced cream is made right in front of you with subtle variations on your classic flavors. This establishment is indeed somewhat pricey, but if you compare it to every other place on the strip, it is a perfectly acceptable amount to pay for a dessert.\\n\\nThe taste is nothing phenomenal, but they way they prepare it kinda is. the ice cream is made right in front of you as they turn milk and fruit into customized ice cream. The cream is poured onto this chilled pan / wok and freezes almost instantly. The ice cream masters then proceed to stir, scrape, slap, and slice the ice cream using knife-like spatulas with such speed and precision that you'd think you were watching a Benihana chef in action. Seriously, if they brought a knife to a gun fight, they would still have a chance at coming out on top.\\n\\nAs for eating the ice cream, the taste was a little light, which is kinda nice after a heavy Las Vegas meal, but deep down, I was kinda hoping for a little more umph from the flavor. Depending on who you get to prepare it, the consistency can be super creamy or hard and dense. If you get a more senior preparer, the cream comes out very smooth and can be almost gelato-like. If your preparer is the young one who has yet to master the tricks of the trade, the cream may be left on the ice pan a bit too long and freeze a little harder than it probably should.\\n\\nWith both ups and downs to this eatery, I think the Yelp rating system hit this one right on the mark, it is A-OK.", "beginning": "Ice Pan is an interesting take on an already saturated"}

{"trgt": "The side of sauteed Spinach was incredibly salty otherwise the color was wonderful and it smelled great. The side of sauteed mushrooms looked really good, but they were way too peppery. I never season my food, when its cooked right there isn't any need to but whoever made those dishes had a very heavy hand. I NEVER leave food behind and I didn't even finish half of them. \\n\\nI had to ask for a steak knife. Waited until someone bothered to make eye contact with me to ask for it by the way. The steak was cooked perfectly - rare just the way I like it and the texture wonderful. The thin french fries were great too, very good! Flavor, texture etc. but as I ate the steak there was way too much seasoning on it as well. Seasoning shouldn't over power the flavor of a good cut of meat and this did. \\n\\nThe biggest issue I had: the staff really needs a lesson in professionalism. I heard one woman behind me talk about a female condom which was just PART of their conversation. They were all huddled in the back while there were people at tables on the floor. Totally turned me off. I saw waitress and waiter in disagreement in the middle of the dining area while setting up a table. One couple complained they had been sitting there ignored. The gentleman got up and said something to a waiter and the manager came over and appeared to make amends in a grandiose way.  My own waiter walked by and for some reason never made eye contact. I was not sure why  - to be clear I NEVER give anyone a hard time nor am I anything other than friendly. Even if the service and food are not up to par. \\n\\nI was seated in the back, on the left (if you are facing the kitchens) so had a birds eye view - and ear - to everything. I told one friend that I actually felt like I was in restaurant boss type episode and there was a hidden camera somewhere, it was that ridiculous with the staff and how they were acting. \\n\\nThe Manager must have realized I heard what I shouldn't have heard because he gave me a box of free pastries and apologized. The staff treated him, quite honestly? - like crap. It was embarrassing. The fact that those kids (some of them - others adults) acted in such a manner in a restaurant that I'd heard NOTHING but rave reviews about? It was disappointing. \\n\\nThe fact I heard him trying to discipline them - they ignored him - was probably not smart on his part either. He seemed frazzled and angry and just disgusted. Lets just say the atmosphere that night was a 1 star. If the staff acts up like that? Get them in the kitchen and send them home, don't do it where patrons can hear.\\n\\nIn all fairness maybe (hopefully for the owner) this was not a regular occurrence because friends of mine RAVE about this place. For breakfast and dinner saying it was one of their favorites. I went on a Coupon to try it out, and at first loved the atmosphere but it went downhill from there. I also can't see paying that kind of money for a meal that was \\\"eh\\\" \\n\\nI always eat every bite on my plate and I savor each one. I didn't take anything with me except the free pastries and my french fries. \\n\\nI judge a place on different criteria and I have a sensitive palate and nose. LOVE food. To cook it, eat it, buy it, read about it etc. I think I am a good judge of what I see, taste, smell and - hear.\\n\\nI'd recommend other places before this one for DINNER - may consider giving them a shot for breakfast type fare and will say the ONE WONDERFUL thing - the best thing about this place - the desserts. They were a little stale but it was after 9pm so that isn't a biggie in my book. \\n\\nI bought a slice of Carrot cake and Tiramisu - the waiter had closed my bill without asking me about desserts at all by the way......I watched a waitress across the room RAVE about them to a full table of people ( I was solo) and she had me craving them. He was going to give them to me for free because he closed the bill out. I insisted on paying for them and will tell you that it was \\\"THE BEST\\\" carrot cake I've ever had! I'd order a whole one for my birthday cake if I could. \\n\\nThe free pastries the Manager gave me? Macaroons are awesome almond cakes too and croissants with chocolate in them. I would recommend this place as a BAKERY and I may give them a shot - after hearing a friend say the crepes were really good - for breakfast. However, not my first choice or even second for Dinner. \\n\\nFor the owner?

It took 35 minutes to get two burgers and an order of sweet potato fries to the table - cold.  The burgers were absolutely nothing special - except very expensive.  The ground beef was fresh but had sat out long enough not to be even luke-warm. Fries were stone cold.  Something I love: $9 for an order of cold fries.  Service was stretched.  Absolutely nothing special about the burgers or BurGR.  Easier to walk a block down the street to get a hot Quarter-Pounder at McDonald's.  You won't get quite the amount of beef but it will be hot and less than an third the price.  You won't be paying for the fancy curved flame wall at the entrance.  While BurGR is less expensive than other casino eateries, it is still in the category of taking your money for little in return.  Try a Big Mac - you and your pocketbook will be happier.

{"trgt": "I had put off trying this restaurant due to the mixed reviews and the doubtful possibility there was quality BBQ in Pittsburgh having been so badly disapointed repeatedly.  I ordered 1/4 pound pork, 1/4 pound ribs and greens.  1/4 pound ribs were 2 bones, very small but very meaty.  I will say that this is the most expensive BBQ I have ever had anywhere in the country without a doubt.  \\n\\nThe ribs and pork have a nice dry rub.  BBQ is never spicy and this isn't either, thankfully.  It doesn't come out sauced, another blessing.  The sauce on the table is nice and complements the rub.  It's a little fruity and tangy breaking up the richness of the pork.  Please watch the char.  Burnt isn't good food.  Seriously!  The pork was succulent, there was lots of fat melting in my mouth and making me wish there was more.  I got the end piece of the rib rack but it was still fairly moist.  I wish there was more but I was already at $15 so I wasn't going to order anything else for lunch.  The greens were spot on.  Very nicely done and the portion size (for the greens) was ok. \\n\\nThe place isn't much to look at.  The service was friendly.  I don't know if it's ever going to be 5 stars for me but I will definitely be back to try it again.\\n\\nI went back!  Took Miriam just a few days later and it was exactly the same.  A good sign.  This time, in addition, I tried the brussel sprouts and they were delicious.  Bring a friend or 3.  If you order more food, the price gets cheaper.  So a 1/2 pound is less than  2 portions of a 1/4 pound for example and you can save money if you share.  It's still expensive but you can do a bit better with some planning.", "beginning": "I had put off trying this restaurant due to the"}

We're excited about this because we tire of driving around in a gas-hog. And Jim is particularly optimistic about a new car because they put a jeep on the list. Now granted, it's not the rubicon of his dreams but it is a \\\"better mileage\\\" jeep and that's a start.\\n\\nSo we went over to Superstition Springs Jeep because they had a number of the specific model on the lot. He wanted to test drive all the choices and decide which car to order.\\n\\nWhen we arrived we were greeted by four salesmen. Jim told them why we were there. As soon as they realized his was to be a fleet purchase they blew us off. They pointed at a group of cars and went under a tree to smoke. We did take a look, not really believing that they actually blew us off like that, but of course all but a couple base models were locked up tight.\\n\\nWe went inside, still hoping to pull this time-waster out of the craper, and Jim went over to the sales manager. He explained what we wanted and what we'd experienced so far. He made clear that being blown off was unacceptable. The manager mumbled something mildly apologetic and walked off. Jim went in search of a fleet person. \\n\\nWhen the manager came back he asked me for the name of my husband's company. I told him and he responded that fleet orders go directly to the factory. The implication was that we couldn't expect anyone to help us because there was nothing in it for them.\\n\\nI told the manager that I considered it a mistake because you never know who you're dealing with. I told him that I might be in the market for a new car in six or eight months (which is true if certain events come to pass) and that I certainly wouldn't buy it anyplace that I was treated so rudely.\\n\\nThe manager looked at me and told me that if that's the way I felt I should go find another dealership to test drive a jeep.\\n\\nLet me repeat that, just in case you missed it. We were treated rudely and when we objected we were told to leave. \\n\\nI think the manager was hoping to intimidate me. At least it seemed that way from the way he towered over me, hands on hips, scowling. But I looked at him, smiled and told him he was absolutely right. I called to Jim, told him what the manager said, and we left.\\n\\nI have to say I am impressed by a company whose commission-only business philosophy involves alienating your customer.

Not much flavor at all really. I've had better general tso's at most other places. The sesame chicken tasted just like the general tso's. Not much flavor. The kung pao chicken probably had even less flavor than the general tso's chicken.\\n\\nI'm not a fan of sushi so I can't comment on Lin's sushi without saying I didn't like it. I don't like seafood in general. Though, the salmon they served was actually something I enjoyed. \\n\\nThe beef from beef and broccoli was okay. It was a little TOO tender, but some may enjoy it falling apart right away. I just like chewing my food instead of being able to just mush it down and swallow it. But not many complaints there.. The only other complaint I really have about the food was some of it was room temperature or cooler. But some was also very warm as they had just brought some out right before I grabbed it. \\n\\nThey have various fruits set out in the dessert section, but the melon wasn't completely ripe so it was a little hard still. Also, it wasn't very cold. I like cold watermelon, and it was warmer than room temperature so I was a little disappointed. The pudding was cold and the ice cream was fine. \\n\\nI rate it 3 stars simply for the jalapeno chicken and friendly wait staff. Being seated quickly and the waitress keeping up on our refills. Other than that, it was pretty mediocre. I've been to way better Chinese buffets back home in Illinois, so it's nothing too special for my taste buds.", "beginning": "Just tried this place out yesterday as I've been looking"}

Yes, they do display fun designs on instagram and overall seem to have a pretty good review, I am just going off of my experience. I had a scheduled trip home for the holidays and decided to give this place a shot. For one it was not relaxing and the two woman working near me were talking amongst themselves about the other female customer (of course not in english). Pedicure did not even come close to what you would get at any other salon. I still had dry skin and it wasn't a relaxing, massage experience I was expecting. The thing that caused me to write the review was when I left and two hours later both big toes completely smudged due to gooey, thick polish. I called the salon- they said they do not guarantee polishes, just 7 days for gel. I said that was fine, most places don't, but they would normally fix a mistake especially within the first few hours. They told me to call back early tomorrow to talk to a manager. I did, manager wasn't there and was going to call me back that afternoon. Nothing. Called the next day same thing. Basically, I never heard from them again and then to make it even better my gel manicure chipped in two places within the 4th-6th day. A regular pedicure and gel manicure cost me $93 plus $10 tip with Winnie. Not my style. Will never go back. Horrible management.

Today I saw it outside as I went to work and it made my day!  It is right in front of St. Paul's on Library Mall.\\n\\nI've tried both the curry tofu and the oseng tahu (candlenut tofu) and both were fantastic!  They were both served with a vegetable mix and then spooned with extra sauce over a bed of fluffy, perfectly cooked rice.  I would say probably a 3:1 or 3:2 tofu to vegetable ratio.\\n-The curry tofu was coconut-based and very mild, sweet, and mellow.  A large pinch of toasted coconut added some texture and heightened the complexity just a touch more. \\n-Of the two tofus, though, I prefer the oseng tahu.  It is a dish that has a bit more bite - not spicy, but that I think it strikes a less sweet note and more of an earthy one.\\n\\nI've never personally tried any of the other dishes, but I've heard great things about the Ayam bakar, which is barbequed chicken breast in a peanut sauce.\\n\\nNOTE: Be sure to take advantage of the condiments next to the forks!  The hot sauce is great if you enjoy your food spicier and the sweet soy-based one is also delicious and would likely be a great accompaniment to the dishes with a thicker-looking peanut sauce to thin it out.\\n\\nAll the entrees come with acar, which is a lightly picked vegetable salad, and krupuk, which are crunchy tapioca puffs.  Both are very tasty and add a refreshing crunch.  Personally, I like to pile my extra rice and sauce on the the krupuk when I am done with my tofu.  \\n\\nThe owner is super friendly,  clearly there are several vegan options, everything seems to be gluten-free.

{"trgt": "What a terrific experience from start to finish, minus like two things.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is very cool. A couple of things I really liked was the way they get ice at the bar. No cubes, just a block of ice and the bartender makes the cubes himself. Also, the \\\"wine cellar\\\" is beautiful, not unique but beautiful. Restrooms are awesome, and their private dining rooms are great with a huge 600 year old tree as a table. It is basically an entire tree, as explained by William, the manager. One thing that bothered me almost the whole meal was the lighting, which was very bright. Finally they turned it down at about 8:30 but it felt like a dining hall for a bit there.\\n\\nMonday night apparently is not a busy night for them, as we were one of three tables, and nobody was at the bar or grill. The server we had was definitely very very good, and perfectly attentive, though as he explained the restaurant and specials he was extremely quiet. I had to ask him to repeat himself and he turned it up, for a second, then turned it back down. Whatever. William, the restaurant manager was awesome as well, making me feel like he was privileged to have me there. We decided to just put them in charge and see what we got with both food and sake. \\n\\nThe first course, Butterfish, was delicious served with a ginger sauce and  some veggies. Second course of Tempura Rock Shrimp was not my favorite, but good. It had a bit of a Mexican flavor with chile and lime. The Pork Belly came next and this was by far my favorite dish, just absolutely perfectly cooked and very flavorful. I did not care for the next which were the chicken skewers. The main course of Rib Eye was average, and I wanted more pork belly. All of the sakes served to us were great, and dessert was wonderful as well. Foodwise, this was a near perfect evening, with only one dish really being blah, and that was the ribeye.\\n\\nI do hope they get busier soon, as they are going to be in trouble if last night was the norm.

It wasn't the same for the tech doing my manicure. \\n\\nWhen I sat down, she started small talk and wanted to know if I wanted my eye brows done. I said no and she said that she does brows. I said no thank you again. My manicure and pedicure were being done at the same time but I could only focus on my hands. She wasn't gentle (I have a cut on my cuticle and she kept sanding my nail beds to the point it irritated the cuticle and skin around my nail bed) and her work was sloppy. \\n\\nShe asked me to pay before I got nails polished, so I handed her my credit card and $20 for her to break. I'm usually very accommodating when nail places ask for tips in cash. She brought back a $10 and two $5's - I asked for one of the $5 to be broken down again.\\n\\nShe must have not liked that - perhaps she was expecting the $5 tip since that's what she gave me. I gave her a little more than 20% - I probably shouldn't have. When she polished my nails, it was sloppy, sloppy, sloppy. I chose a darker color so even the smallest smudge is easily seen. I thought she might go back and clean it up, but she didn't.

{"trgt": "Their lack of service really outweighed the quality of their food, so for that I am giving them one star (I wish I could give none).\\n\\nThe waitresses thoroughly pissed both me and my bf off. First of all, we were the first people to go into the restaurant at 11am. Once we entered, they looked over at us from the bar and I said \\\"hello\\\" with a smile on my face, which was quickly turned into a scowl after they just stared at us without responding. We just stood their for 5 minutes while they kept on talking to each other at the bar. Then FINALLY one of them comes up to us and says \\\"yes, what can i help you with?\\\" \\\"um, we're here for breakfast\\\" is what we said. Then she told us to sit in the front without even bringing us over to a table. \\n\\nWe picked out what we wanted fairly quickly. We both got Cuban style breakfasts which were $8.95 each (pretty overpriced for what you get). My plate consisted of some plantains, two potato balls, two pieces of toast, and eggs....for $8.95. Which reminds me that they totally screwed up on my order. I ordered scrambled eggs and my boyfriend ordered his over easy. They brought us our plates (after about 20 minutes of waiting even though we were the only customers) and both plates had over easy eggs. I didn't even bother complaining because I knew it was just going to take even longer and we were on pressed time. I felt like they just did all the eggs over easy to make it simpler for themselves. \\n\\nMy bf finished his plate first and he scooted his empty plate to the side of the table so the waitress could see and pick it up. Instead the waitress sat some lady that just arrived to a booth next to us and started talking to her in Spanish for a while, took her order, then walked right past our table without taking the plate or giving us and refills. Shortly after that, I finished my plate of food. At that point there were TWO empty plates at the side of the table and TWO empty cups next to them. It really ticked me off to see the waitress bring the lady's order out right away, talk to her some MORE, then pass our table ONCE AGAIN without doing anything. We were literally sitting there doing nothing. \\n\\nThe waitress went to the lady's table again to talk to her some more and that's when my boyfriend asked her for the bill, then she asked us if we wanted some refills and took our plates. If that's what it takes to get refills and a clean table at this place then that's just ridiculous.\\n\\nShe came out with not our bill, but the bill for the lady in the booth next to us. WTF that really got us mad! That lady next to us arrived about 30 minutes after we arrived.  We asked for the bill ONCE AGAIN and she brought it out along with the other lady's change. My bf slammed his card on the bill right away cuz we were not in the mood to wait any longer. \\n\\nAs we waited for the waitress to bring us the receipt I noticed all the other waitresses just standing around the bar DOING NOTHING BUT TALKING TO EACH OTHER AND LOOKING AT THEMSELVES IN THE MIRROR. That's probably what they do all day long since the bar has a wall made up of mirrors. It was so annoying, there was about 5 other waitresses and not one of them could give us good service. I noticed one of the waitresses made a stripper outfit out of her uniform. All of her tramp stamp tattoos were showing since she rolled her shirt up and she was wearing hoochi shorts, I found it very unprofessional. \\n\\nOur receipt finally came. I begged my bf not to give a tip, unfortunately he did lol, but it was only 5 percent. They really deserved less considering they neglected the hell out of us . \\n\\nI don't know if it was because of the way we looked (my bf has dreads and I have a nose piercing) but the service was just horrible and it seemed like it was only like that for us. Either way, no establishment should be run like this. \\n\\nWe still want to try the Cuban buffet and we plan on doing so next week. Luckily with buffets you go and get your own food, so we won't be needing much of their services. I guess then I'll be able to post something about their food.

Place was mostly cleared out, I'd say that about 60% of the restaurant was completely open.\\n\\nI sat down with my girlfriend, waiter shows up to get our order, we get some appetizers, cheese sticks to start off with.     Now me and my girlfriend are sitting watching the game, the cheese sticks arrive, they're pretty good, and everything is cool.\\n\\n  Then the waiter comes back within about a minute of bringing the cheese sticks and asks if we're ready to order, we shake our heads as we haven't even finished eating the cheese sticks.\\n\\nWithin another minute, he's back again, so we just go ahead and order our entrees and everything is cool, the waiter vanishes, and we're back to watching the football game.\\n\\n\\nWe get our entrees, I ordered a Big Jack Daddy burger, normally delicious but somewhat off, the pulled pork was cold, the burger was dry and had barely any BBQ sauce on it so I asked the waiter for some.  My girlfriend's biting into her chicken tenders which also were somewhat under-par.      The waiter comes back with the BBQ sauce, then disappears again, we're watching the football game and within a few minutes, he's back, asking if we want desert.................um, while I'm not even halfway done with my entree.       We say no, go back to our food and at this point, some Buffalo Wild Wings honcho, maybe a manager stops by our table and asks how things are, I say alright although privately I'm starting to feel a bit crowded.\\n\\n  Then as I'm just finishing my entree, the waiter comes by, swoops the plate and takes off.    Next thing I know he's coming to the table, shoving the check next to me and saying he can \\\"get it whenever we're ready\\\", which at this point I feel like I'm getting the bum's rush and I look around the restaurant and realize that its even emptier than we got there.       I made a point of asking him if maybe they were closing early or something and he got defensive and walked off.    \\n\\n  At that point, I didn't see him the rest of the night, but I did notice on the bill that he had the audacity to charge us for the extra BBQ sauce I asked for to cover up the dryness of the overcooked burger and the fact that they barely put any sauce on it to begin with.    \\n\\n\\n The fact I was being charged for BBQ sauce in a place that serves it up en masse was ridiculous.     What's next?   Fork and knife rental fees?   First time I've been charged for that at any restaurant, and especially at Buffalo Wild Wings.        Putting that on top of the lousy, pushy service was enough for me to leave the lowest tip I've left at any restaurant.         \\n\\n\\n   I'd understand on a busy night about table turnover but sitting back on a nearly completely dead evening, we're one of a few handful of tables actually filled in the waiter's section, watching a football game while ordering food and getting basically tossed out.     No thanks, there's many other places where I can get decent food without being treated like the waiter is doing me a favor and not the other way around.  \\n\\n\\nI'll try the Buffalo Wild Wings location out at Norterra but this whole experience was pretty much a bust for me, cold food, dry burger, lousy service and on top of that, getting nickel and dimed on the BBQ sauce.

Everyone has that nightmare thought of what if a place will neglect them and just care about the money?  \\n\\nAfter so much hub bub of researching and asking around, I decided to pop in with my dogs to see how they would react to the people and the place. They seemed fine so we booked out trip. \\n\\nThey give you a webcam address that you can access on your computer or there is a phone app to access their feed. Mind you the cameras are still and do not show the whole room so sometimes your dog may be on the fringes like mine were. Unfortunately those two were mostly on the fringes so I had to check often to even see where they are and would get a few moments of seeing them run onto screen and run back out of range. Still nice to see them and general monitor the facility. I saw people come in and sit on the couches and pet all the dogs so it was nice to see they were friendly to the dogs and the dogs were happy to see them whenever they were there. \\n\\nThey seem okay when we got them, but passed out as soon as we got home. Figured, even though they slept and all there it wasn't the relaxed sleep they get being next to me. \\n\\nI had a groupon to use with a bath and brush grooming so I asked if I can have their nails trimmed too while they get groomed. Theirs was very long and I get nervous about trying to cut my girl down short with her black nails. They didn't take much off, just the tips so it didn't feel like it was worth $8 each when at the vets they cut it down to be short.  \\n\\nI got their food bags back and only half their food has been used. Remember how I said I was really freakish about their food diet? Well, I measured out portions for all the days plus one extra days worth incase. They put it in a bag so I didn't see until I got home or I might have asked about it. I don't know if they weren't eating because they're nervous or that 1 cup meals was misunderstood between both and not each since I just made a big bag with both their names on it and measurement directions. \\n\\nWhen we picked them up, all the feedback we got from the lady was they \\\"did great and were fine\\\". If they weren't eating then I don't think so and I should have been told as it can be useful to know in case I board them again. More details than that would have been nice since I've never boarded them there, never left them with anyone EVER. \\n\\nI think overall this place is decent though. I like that the camera feed is given and the access is 24/7 (some shut it after the place closes for the night). The price is just right and great value for multiples. Many places only charge PER DOG and here there are multiple dog prices. I boarded two for $45 (average in other places is $30-$40 per dog). My dogs seem to not be unhappy being there and approached staff on camera so they had to be treated well. One of my dogs is skittish and if she was not treated well by someone, she will usually space herself from that person. \\n\\nI will be using them again for boarding as I at least feel comfortable knowing that my dogs are okay with this place and the staff.", "beginning": "I was really worried about going on any vacation without"}

I read the other yelp reviews before heading in but I had also gotten massages by blind people in China, which were awesome, so I went in with an open mind.  She was nice and had a good energy but her technique was not refined.  Her strokes were short and clumsy and I don't think she even has a massage license (I didn't have the heart to ask).  She tried getting the pressure points, but missed, she didn't really know how to get rid of my huge shoulder knot and I kind of just wanted the massage to be over.  She was quick on each of the body parts and she had this kind of timer device that she checked periodically and when she realized that there's still plenty of time left, she would find a body part to massage.  It was like child's play massage.  When I left the room, her husband wasn't sitting out in the waiting area like another yelper had mentioned before, but he was in the salon because I heard him later on.\\n\\nSo there was some mix up with my appointment because instead of getting a facial right after my massage, I was taken in for my pedicure.  The lady, Tanya was a little off.  She didn't have me pick out my nail color first, and she had me soaking in the water too long because she had to finish up with someone else.  My feet were so pruney that I think she cut my skin while cutting my nails but it's hard for me to tell.  She didn't ask how I liked my nails cut and made them round when I like them square.  Her painting job was amateur to say the least, there's paint all over my cuticles and skin.  She was nice but I'm paying for a service to be done properly.  My paint job was better than this one, I'm really tempted to just remove the color so I can re-do it myself.  Tanya was also talking to me for so long that she didn't watch the time and we were going over.\\n\\nJulie then took me in for my facial and she was very polite and professional - she apologized for the mix-up, the regular receptionist is away getting married or something, so hence the confusion.  She also apologized for Tanya and also for her daughter that had come to hang out at the salon.  Julie's facial was good, she put me to sleep at one point, so that's a good sign.\\n\\nI like small businesses because 90% of businesses are small businesses, however, I don't like small businesses that doesn't focus on the customer - because, hello, that's who's paying the bills!  \\nGotta cater to the customers so they will come back.", "beginning": "My sister purchased a livingsocial voucher for me as a"}

But from now on, I'll stick with the lawn. It's a better crowd anyway.\\n\\nDrink prices are no more than any other concert venue and there are plenty of choices, even a tequila bar.

Both myself and my daughter love salmon sashimi so we ordered it as usual. What they placed on our table was NOT salmon sashimi. It had the look and texture of smoked salmon. We brought it to the attention of the staff. Unbelieveable that they truly believed it was how it was supposed to look. I've had more than my fair share over the years and have never come across such stupidity. How can you serve sashimi to people that has been cooked and is obviously not RAW? So the guy took it back and brought out another serving of the same exact thing. Same conversation again. I finally had him take it back and got the tuna instead which I didn't want but was ok. I can't walk into the place again knowing that their sushi chef can't tell the difference... it's embarrassing for them. Even before the food was served my three year old knocked over a small cup of water. Not one single person on the staff... who by the way weren't doing anything but talking behind the counter, made an attempt to offer us a towel to wipe it from the table or the floor.

{"trgt": "Il Fornaio was conveniently located in the downstairs of my room in NYNY and, after walking by it several times, my friend and I decided to eat dinner there on December 23rd.  \\n\\nFirst, our waitress was extremely nice and attentive.  Our water glasses were constantly filled, our request for more oil and vinegar came immediately, empty plates were cleared off the table quickly.  I really appreciated our waitress' attentiveness and outstanding service.\\n\\nSecond, the inside dining area was beautiful and quiet.  It had an outstanding atmosphere for conversation.  The place was incredibly clean, spacious and chique.   I  thought the restaurant was a bit too dark but I guess it created a more intimate ambiance. \\n\\nThird, the food was outstanding and, with the special 3-course meal for $33, we thought it was very reasonably priced.  The bread served to us at the beginning was crisp outside and soft delicious inside.  \\n\\nWhat did I order? I cannot remember (let alone pronounce) the fancy Italian words so bear with me as I describe the items I ordered. The appetizer was a flatbread which was almost the size of an A4 paper covered with toppings and lots lots lots of delicious cheese.  The main consisted of spinach, grilled chicken and potatoes. The spicy sauce was really the superstar of that plate.  It was too bad that I ran out of sauce halfway though my chicken. Next time, more sauce please!  And, finally, for my dessert, I ordered the tiramisu - a large square-shaped decadent light fluffy cake with layers of rich creamy coffee filling.  \\n\\nIf there's anything to improve, I'd say the portions have to be smaller.  Strange how my feedback contradicts the complaint from a previous reviewer saying the portions were too small?  I found the appetizer was far too large and (combined with the bread at the beginning) I've eaten too many carbs that, by the time I reached my main, I was already full and couldn't enjoy it as much.

Unfortunately, I only have that one experience upon which to base my assessment of Pyarr. \\n\\nLocated in Village Square, just a few doors down from the Regal Cinemas, Pyarr is relatively new, and its obvious it hasn't built up its clientele yet. I visited during the lunch buffet with a friend one weekday, and we were the only other people dining in there aside from one guy at his lonely table. Seating was open, but we were promptly greeted and quickly brought water as our drink orders were being taken, which left us to hit up the buffet.\\n\\nOf course, this is where my review gets highly subjective. The buffet selection was, let's say, not impressive. Especially not if you're a vegetarian (hello!). There were only eight-to-10 hot plates from which to choose, and none of these were fried goodies such as samosa, pakora or papadum. The selection does change daily, but I'd rather see Pyarr ixnay the bulk of its mostly ignored cold condiment selections to make room for more hot stuff. And maybe they will when business picks up.\\n\\nThe buffet does include a serving of their fresh naan, however, and I will say this: I think this is the best naan I've had in Vegas, even counting my beloved India Palace. And even though the selection was weak, the food I did have (jeera rice, aloo palak, yellow daal) was tasty and just spicy enough.\\n\\nThe service was excellent. We were being checked up on regularly, asked for feedback on specific dishes, re-filled with beverages (maybe not accurately, but ...), etc. Again, this might have been because we were the only people in the joint, but hey, it's something.\\n\\nEither way, I plan to come back to explore the menu further during dinner hours, so I can maybe give a more well-rounded review.", "beginning": "It's really not fair to rate an Indian restaurant based"}

FYI, Indians from India (my parents) call all white dudes \\\"Americans\\\" as if we are not Americans but I thought would throw some humor your way in case you were already bored reading the typical \\\"The spiciness wasn't there\\\" review\\n\\nIn terms of the menu, I don't think Dhaba knows how it's trying to position itself. Are they a chaat house, a classic Indian restaurant, a fusion Indian restaurant....and that is the problem with this place, it's  a smorgasboard...a jack of all trades yet a master of none.  And that's exactly felt in the cuisine. The samosa chaat was amazing, the other chaat....bleh!  The chicken tikka masa was very good but the certainly not crave-worthy meaning  it lacked the\\\"Hey I'm dying for some great chicken tikka masala, let me order this to go\\\" quality. It's really hit or miss with their dishes as some are completely amateur like their chicken tikka(not the curry but the grilled version) which tasted like chicken cooked on a Forman grill and was then allowed to cool to room temperature and served on a plate...not exactly appetizing. Their daal was really good but their saag was okay.\\n\\nAnd to Wendi below, we don't eat salads.  Indian people created salads for you guys. So when you tell me there is a new salad on the menu each day, I envision someone at a Chinese restaurant saying we are offering a different style of pizza today. That's a not a good thing. If the guy is listening to Pink Floyd, that means the dial is moving even further away on the authentic meter. What's next, are they going to start offerring hooka and child's chicken finger and fries plate?\\nDon't get me wrong, Dhaba is one of the few Indian restaurants in Phoenix that I will actually dine at since most are terrible and that's not me being critical. Phoenix is a great place for bad Indian restaurants to thirve since the population is clueless when it comes to Indian food and you could seriously serve up some ground beef with curry and give it a name and they would think it's a legitimate and authentic dish...and this goes for the white dudes living in London who comes on these forums and tells us they know great Indian food when they give places like India Gate 5 stars....but I digress. Okay so if you are not an Indian food snob and want to break out of your routine of eating at Black Angus, this is a good place to start. If you have eaten great Indian food and are not easily mesmerized by a nice atmosphere go down McClintock and take a left on Broadway and try Royal Taj", "beginning": "I walked into this place thinking: \\\"Oh man, you know"}

Cheeses were fresh, imported from France. \\n6. Five traditional tarts slices - chocolate (just OK), white chocolate with lemon sauce, pineapple filling & earl gray toasted rice crispies (the best of the 5), chocolate cinnamon ganache (deceivingly rich), raspberry (fresh and light), and Snickers (very rich, although an actual Snickers bar isn't hard to recreate :-P)\\n7. Anchovy, red bell pepper, and eggplant  confit - must eat all ingredients together for proper seasonings and savoriness. Without the anchovies, the entire dish is bland and oily. Ample servings to share. I had to eat it with bread to balance out the oil.\\n8. Seasonal vegetable salad - wayyyy too much olive oil; even after eating, we had 3 tbsp left of oil on the bottom of the plate. Seasonal vegetables = olives, endives, butter lettuce, and avocado. Definitely not to be ordered again!\\n9.

{"trgt": "My wife and I were excited to try this place as the menu looked good and they offered an $80 groupon which helps \\\"offset\\\" the tourist pricing of these types of places (we are Las Vegas residents).  The staff was nice and attentive, and if based solely on them this would be a solid 4 star review.  The food, however was very average at best and  very expensive for what it was.  We started with a $16 chop salad that was VERY SMALL and very average, especially for the price.  It never ceases to amaze me how some high end places skimp on stuff like this that costs them mere pennies (iceberg lettuce and a few other cheap ingredients) and would definitely add more value to an expensive meal without much more expense on their part.  The bread was very crappy and either stale or lightly toasted, not sure which one.  Any italian place, especially high end ones should really focus on having quality bread as this is an italian staple.  The entrees came out, my chicken picatta was OK flavorwise, but it was NOT a chicken breast (first time I have had that happen anywhere) but rather a thigh.  About 5 bites of chicken and that was it.  My wife's lobster ravioli was a much larger portion and was pretty good overall, the one bright spot in the meal (although still a $36 entree).  Three glasses of lower end wine and we were already well over $100 for a relatively small quantity of average food.  Honestly, the Olive Garden is much better than this place.  I know not to expect too much from places that are meant to squeeze tourists, but there are many, many better places to go on the Vegas strip that give you much more value when they charge these high prices.", "beginning": "My wife and I were excited to try this place"}

But we saw all the empty tables so we thought were good.  Asked the hostess for a table for 2.  She said the wait time will be about 30 minutes.  And we're like OK no problem.  Then we saw the empty tables outside as well.  So I asked her again if the wait time is still 30 minutes if we are to sit outside?  Surprisingly she still said yes.  So we're out there sitting and after about 30 minutes she comes out and asks \\\"oh did you want to just eat out here?\\\".  And we're like - uhmmm yeah???  Unless I was speaking Martian, I swear I remember telling her that some 30 mins earlier.  I decided to skip the steak and instead got the salmon.  My buddy got the steak.  He said the steak was disappointingly dry.  The salmon I had was too greasy.  Very lousy food.  In my opinion I can maybe cut them some slack on the lousy food if their service wasn't terrible.  Why the F would they let us sit outside for 30 mins with 10s of empty tables?  Is it because we're too casual for their \\\"crowd\\\"?  Maybe because were not wearing suits?  Or maybe they just don't give a F*** about people who just walk in without a reservation?  This used to be a must-stop for me whenever I go to Madison.

{"trgt": "Eh, maybe I'm a tough critic but this place met my standards for a DECENT Ramen joint. I've eaten a lot of Ramen from Las Vegas to So-cal and Nor-cal. I've even attempted Man vs Food's challenge at Orochan Ramen (Little Tokyo's) Spiciest & biggest Ramen bowl. So I know my Ramen, and this place was A-OK but I've tried better. \\n\\nRamen Noodle:4/5 I liked the noodles, it was a bit thicker and chewier than most Ramen joints I've tried but I didn't like how chewy it was. Thicker was a plus but chewy no. \\n\\nBroth Spicy Miso: 3/5 I ordered the SPICY MISO RAMEN which was actually not spicy at all. Even though the soup turned red after mixing it a bit, but don't let looks fool you. The broth was a bit greasy you could see the oil bubbles this was definitely a turn off. The broth was very light, I felt like the broth was missing something. \\n\\nBroth Chashu Miso: 2/5 The broth was very light and oily. Once again I felt like it was missing something, NOT ENOUGH FLAVOR. I barely tasted the Miso and everyone knows Miso is salty which made the soup not as salty as most soups I've tried.\\n\\nChashu: 2/5 The Chashu pork, if you know what Chashu pork is its really Pork belly. That's simmered for about an hour slow cooking so its soft tasty and chewy. The pork belly they used was more pork less fat which was okay but everyone knows the flavor is in the fat. The Chashu pork was a bit chewier than most I've tried but also remember it was more meat than fat. My order came with one slice so I ordered extra Chashu because I love chashu pork, but I'm not a fan of theirs. \\n\\nTamago (egg) : 0/5 REMEMBER! The order does not come with a Tamago, even if on the menu there's a picture of one. I guess I assumed on the menu the picture was exactly what I was ordering. I usually like 2 tamago's so I ordered 1 extra. Not knowing I was ordering just HALF of an egg. So When I got my miso ramen I was sad to see I only had 1 half of a tamago. THE TAMAGO was TASTELESS! No flavor at all. A real tamago is kepted over night in a soy sauce based sweet sauce. But this was NOT A TAMAGO. The Tamago WASN'T EVEN BROWN! The Tamago is my favorite part of my ramen and they totally ruined it.\\n\\nAlcohol: 0/5 Currently they don't have their liquor license which makes it such a tease on the menu because who doesn't love to enjoy a Sapporo beer with their Ramen. Instead I was forced to enjoy my Ramen with a glass of water imprinted with the Sapporo sticker (even more of a tease)\\n\\nService: 2/5 The waitress and the waiter were super nice but not so much the manager. My boyfriend eats a lot, so he ordered a large which was suppose to have more noodles and more soup but it wasn't enough for him. So we asked and offered to pay for more noodles since he still had a lot of soup left but they said no we would have to buy a whole new bowl which was a big disappointment because at MONTA my boyfriend always orders more noodles with no problem \\n \\nParking: 5/5 The place was dead, when I pulled in there had to be 2 other cars there. They have a small back parking lot which is a plus. \\n\\nWait: 5/5 THERE IS NO WAIT! Which was awesome because I was hungry when I got there.

He picked up my empty plate and was gone. \\n\\nI wasn't quite sure if he knew I was headed to the show like the rest of the patrons or he just wanted me gone and out of there. I did ask him about the quickness of the pork tenderloin so I'm not sure if he just assumed I was in a hurry and was trying to help me out or what. As a whole I really hate getting my check without being offered anything else or while I'm still eating...but I'll give the server the benefit of the doubt with this one. \\n\\nOn the way out I did ask when they closed because I was thinking of coming back for the pumpkin cheesecake after the show but they closed at 10 so that wouldn't work. \\n\\nSo, next time I'm in the area I'd like to check it out again when I have some more time.

The cookies are generously sized and delicious as-is.

Josh took really good care of us.  We found our server as well as other staff members to be quite attentive.\\n\\nI ordered a fillet and my wife ordered the Cowboy Rib Eye.  We both ordered our steaks medium rare . . . . well, they didn't come out that way . . . they were more medium to medium well and the cooking was very inconsistent.\\n\\nWe both think it has to do with the cooking process . . . they boast that they cook the steaks at 1000 degrees and then bring them to your table on a plate that is 500 degrees.  But what happens is that the steak continues to cook on the plate so that when it arrives . . . it is medium well on the outside . . . and continues to get more done the longer it is on the plate.\\n\\nAnd what's with all the butter on the steak?  Both steaks were covered in butter and it pooled on the plate. . . .both steaks were a bit salty as well. . . . . the cut of meat seemed good . . . it didn't need all that butter and salt on it.\\n\\nThe sides are extra at $10 each . . . the baked potato was good and the creamed spinach was excellent.\\n\\nAs for the deserts . . . . the chocolate cake was excellent and the creme brulee was good.\\n\\nIn summary, we won't be going back to RC anytime soon as there are several steak houses that a much better and actually more reasonable . . . . to give just a few examples, I would rather go to Carve at Eastside Cannery; Fuego at the Fiesta; Hanks at GV Ranch; or one of my favs Hugo's Cellar on Fremont Street.\\n\\nLastly, before RC, this restaurant was called The Range.  I miss that place as it was much better than RC's.

{"trgt": "I pass through Charlotte at least a couple times per year, typically around the holidays, and usually meet up with friends to grab a bite to eat.  Tonight, we ended up in Plaza Midwood (a small neighborhood with trendy eateries) at Dish.  Dish is a casual Southern restaurant with a laid back atmosphere, friendly staff, and reasonably priced food.\\n\\nThe restaurant has a bit of an old school Southern feel to it with its small wooden tables and chairs, vinyl tablecloths, and retro signage and decor.  The menu features Southern staples such as chicken and dumplings, meatloaf, shrimp and grits, and a pot roast.  They also serve Mexican items (burritos and quesadillas) and sandwiches.\\n\\nI was drawn to their BBQ sliders appetizer because it included three sliders with a choice of three sauces: eastern NC (vinegar based), SC (mustard based), and \\\"Chicago\\\" (sweet tomato based).  I asked for one slider with each sauce.  Each slider had pulled pork with the sauce poured on top, inside of a biscuit with a pickle on top.  The plate was served with a small sample of Carolina-style cole slaw (vinegar, no mayo).  There was not as much meat as I hoped and while the biscuits were good, there was too high of a bread-to-meat ratio for my liking.\\n\\nLike other Southern restaurants, Dish offers vegetable plates.  Each vegetable plate comes with a biscuit, glazed on top with honey, and a deviled egg.  I tried the mac and cheese, squash casserole, and mashed sweet potatoes.  The noodles in the mac and cheese were your typical small sized mac and cheese noodles (like you make at home).  Good texture and not too oily.  Squash casserole tasted homemade (in a good way).  Not a huge fan of the mashed sweet potatoes, but you could tell they were freshly mashed sweet potatoes and not processed.  Check out my photos to see the food.\\n\\nOur server was Mollie and she provided good service.  The food came out fast.  The restaurant has a bar in the back and also has a bunch of unique paintings.  Not sure if they are for sale, but they were interesting to look at.  There's plenty of free parking in the open lot across the street from the entrance.", "beginning": "I pass through Charlotte at least a couple times per"}

The taste wasn't bad but after a $50 tab, my guest and I left unsatisfied and still hungry. They have a $5 tapas menu which I tried the bacon wrapped dates off of. There were only 5 dates which tasted amazing but again, the portion was ridiculous. The same thing with the rolls, the caterpillar had great flavor but there were 8 slices of the smallest roll I've ever had and it cost $13.

{"trgt": "The renowned Lotus of Siam was a definite stop for the fianc\\u00e9e and me on our trip to Las Vegas.  We went for lunch on a Friday afternoon arriving a little before 1 PM.  As mentioned by many other reviewers, Lotus of Siam is located in a sketchy-looking strip mall off of Sahara.  Unlike some others, though, we thankfully avoided being accosted by panhandlers likely because it was midday in July and we cabbed over from the Hard Rock (approx. $20 ride with tip), which let us off right at the front door.  Once inside, Lotus of Siam looked like pretty much every other family run Thai restaurant, although it was, perhaps, a bit larger and definitely more decked out with photos of celebs who've eaten there.  \\n\\nFor lunch, Lotus of Siam offers an AYCE buffet as well its full menu.  Skip the buffet.  We looked it over, but it was the standard fare you see on every Thai buffet line.  Instead, we elected to go with ordering off of the menu, which was more difficult than you'd think with over 150 various dishes to be found on its encyclopedic menu.  We started off with the Nam Kao Tod.  The complex m\\u00e9lange of crispy rice, minced pork, green onions, fresh chilis, ginger, peanuts and lime juice was as tasty as it's been described by countless Yelpers.  Next, we had the Kang Ka Noon, a northern style curry made with young jack fruit chunks, with pork.  Not being familiar with northern Thai cuisine and jack fruit, we took a leap of faith on this dish.  Our faith was rewarded with deliciousness, although it was definitely less spicy or \\\"curry-like\\\" than our preconceived notions of a Thai curry dish.  Finally, we had the Sea Bass on Drunken Noodle.  The sea bass was delicately deep fried, then topped with a fresh chili and Thai basil sauce and served over pan fried, flat rice noodles.  The fish was moist.  The sauce was spicy and flavorful.  The noodles were perfectly pan fried, still tender, without dryness or rubberiness.  \\n\\nLotus of Siam may be overhyped, but damn if it wasn't the best Thai food I can ever recall having!  The ingredients were fresh and the flavors and colors were bold and bright.  Given that there are well over a hundred items we still haven't tried, it's a sure thing that we'll be back.", "beginning": "The renowned Lotus of Siam was a definite stop for"}

In my entire life I have never sent my food back, but after my first bite of the Chicken and Chorizo Paella I looked down at this huge plate of food and had to send it back. It had a really strange after taste that I can't accurately describe, but I knew I didn't want another bite. At least they did take it off our bill, but a manager never came over. On our way out I think the guy holding the door was the manager; he asked how it was and I was honest. He just mentioned that he would speak to the chef - didn't offer a gift card or anything at all. The service was pretty bad also. One guest didn't like their drink after the first sip and nothing was offered other than to curb it by adding Sprite. Bottled beer is $5.50, drinks are about $10, tapas are roughly $6-12 and the Paella is about $35. They only have 1 draft beer. One positive is that they have a few large TVs that were easy to see, but instead of playing sound from the football game they had slow depressing music. The restaurant isn't very big either. If you were to compare this place to Firefly, it's no contest, Firefly is considerably better - I'll gladly take my chances with Salmonella.

It's located in a primarily Korean shopping center. Cool. We called ahead and made an appointment. We arrived on time and were promptly escorted to our massage area. Now, I know what I was going to be expecting at a place like this as I frequent one similar in my hometown. Every thing started off great until my massage person came in. I am solely basing this review on my massage alone, my husband enjoyed his massage very much and even feel asleep and was snoring. I'm going to start off by saying that my massage person must have just broken up with her boyfriend or something because I was basically tapped and punched through out the whole massage. I asked her to be more gentle about half way through and that lasted for about a second. My whole \\\"massage\\\" basically went like this...tap tap tap, knead knead knead, punch punch. It was truly un-enjoyable and almost unbearable at times...I would have tenderized a piece of meat more gently than the massage I was given.

As such, considering the pedestal this place has been put on, I've taken a different approach to grading The Witchery. I call it the \\\"benefit-of-the-doubt' rating system. Goes like this...I gave it 5 stars before I even sat down. Then, took away and added stars as the meal progressed. So, the stars were their's to lose. \\n\\nWent there for lunch....results:\\n\\nAmbience - Excellent. Let me just say that this place is spectacular.....out a movie set or fiction novel. But, it's very real and in a beautiful 16th century historic building. A very cool and other-worldly ambience. We sat in the Secret Garden area downstairs...loved it....no stars lost. \\n\\nService - Fair. Attentive when they were around. But, too slow for me. Big delay between apps and main course even though we were the 2nd table seated. Overall, took 2 hours for lunch and we were never offered anything else to drink after our initial drink orders...not even water....had to ask for everything...1 star lost.\\n\\nDrinks - Excellent. Judy had a Pimm's, wife had a glass of sauv blanc and I had a Hendrick's Martini with a cuke garnish. Plus, after-lunch cappuccino's were excellent...1 star awarded (they're back to 5 stars!).\\n\\nApps - Underwhelmed. A selection of bread and butter was served. Bread seemed day-old and cold but tasted OK. I prefer warm bread. Wife had oysters on the half shell and they were reported to be good. I had a seafood bisque and it was presented nicely in an iron pot with crostini (croutons) and parmesan and rouille on the side. But, it was a vey thin soup that didn't have a distinct flavor....I'm sure it was a lot of work but it just tasted like some basic fish stock. I usually think of a bisque as being thicker and richer but this may just be a cultural thing. It was neither good nor bad....1 star lost.\\n\\nMain Course - This one is tricky. Kids split the roasted chicken with fondant potato and green beans and chips on the side. My wife and Judy got the roasted, hot-smoked salmon with sweet potatoes and green beans. My mother-in-law Mary and I both got Guy Grieve's scallops w/ pancetta and whipped potatoes. Here's the rundown...kids' chicken had good flavor but was very dry....seemed like it may have sat for a while. Their chips were very good, though. The salmon was reported from wife and Judy as being simple but very good. Seems like it had a lemon/butter-based sauce with it and served with green beans. They really liked the dish. Everything about the scallop dish was mediocre. Whipped potatoes were cold (ok, luke warm), scallops were over cooked or had been sitting under a salamander for too long. Pancetta was hard and chewy. Salad was not memorable....1 star lost.\\n\\nSo, it was an OK experience in the end. My wife and Judy enjoyed their meals. Mary and I didn't. All agreed the service was not the best. But, all agreed the ambience was outstanding.

I visited this place three times while staying at Planet Hollywood, once for breakfast, once for lunch, and once at (ahem) maybe around 2am.

This is sort of an up-jumped Quiznos with the added bonus that the bread starts out unbaked and bakes as it's going through the conveyor belt. However the ingredients going in to the sandwich seem fairly standard for fast food quality, maybe slightly better, and the flavor coming out the other end simply wasn't there for me. Yeah they're greasy gut bombs and people like that, but coming from the land of Bunk Sandwiches (greasy gut bombs that they be), this is nowhere near what I'd consider to be gourmet or even all that great. \\n\\nDon't get me wrong.

I had to approach them to ask about my appointment and how much longer the wait would be, since obviously making an appointment did not seem to guarantee anyone would see me.But the ultimate reason I chose not to continue to work with the artist there, besides her telling me she couldn't do a tattoo on my leg, was because she suggested to me that I should get liposuction. She said it would be a better investment for me to pay for plastic surgery rather than get a tattoo and that I should consider losing some weight before I get any tattoos. I am an average sized person - I would not consider myself overweight and I was insulted she would tell me that I need to get liposuction before she would tattoo me. Customer service is not a priority at Club Tattoo. And my experience with this artist has made me not want to go to any Club Tattoo location for future work.", "beginning": "I chose not to get a tattoo here after my"}

Not at all what I expected from this place given all the hype.\\n\\nWe had a table reservation for a group of five guys and two girls with a $3000 minimum.  We arrived around midnight and were seated pretty promptly at a prime dance floor table, as we expected for the amount we paid on a regular Friday night.  \\n\\nThe table next to us was crowded with girls and only girls - most of them hot local girls.  They were drinking for free from the cheapest bottles and were clearly \\\"employed\\\" by the club, whether they were actually paid or simply lured by free bottles.  This fact became even more evident when we ordered our champagne and vodka and the bottle waitress pointed over to the girls' table and told us that if we see any we like we should point them out and she would bring them over.  It's standard practice in Las Vegas for staff members to bring girls to tables, but I found taking it to this level quite hilarious; regardless, props to them if it works as a business model.\\n\\nA little later on in the night, after having chatted with one of the girls from the pro-clubber table, her group of friends was sent off (sold?) to another big spending table. I decided to take the waitress up on her earlier offer to send ladies over.  At this point, to reach our $3000 minimum, we had purchased several bottles of vodka and champagne, much of which was still on our table unopened.  I asked the waitress about sending some girls over, and she replied, in the rudest manner I've ever experienced at a nightclub, \\\"You're drinking Stoli.  Girls aren't attracted to Stoli.  You should order something else if you want girls to come to your table.\\\"\\n\\nLuckily, it wasn't tough to find girls (she was quite wrong about girls and their attraction to Stoli), but this level of attitude is hardly what I would expect from someone set to make a minimum $750 gratuity from serving a single table.

{"trgt": "In a market that is known for it's golf this course leaves a lot to be desired. My wife and I are avid golfers and we love to take advantage of Groupon deals for golf in the area. We purchased this Groupon for $50. This gave us a day of golf, cart, range balls and lunch. So let's start with the range. Keeping in mind that the range is not the most important thing about a golf course, it still does matter. The range had NO grass besides where you were hitting from. It was like hitting balls into the abyss. After we finish up there we move on to the 1st hole which is across the street and down a sidewalk. You would expect signs leading you to the first hole but there was not. Fortunately the guy in the pro shop was aware and came out to tell us as he saw us asking others where to find the first hole. Now to the course itself. This course was in horrible condition. I understand that we overseed during certain times of the year here but never have I played a course during this time that was in this poor of condition. First off, there is dirt everywhere around this course. The sand traps were hard as a rock, it was almost like hitting out of cement when we landed there. But viewing them, it looked like an old dried up river. While on the course it was so loud! Keep in mind we played on a Sunday, yet they had guys out there seeding??? On a Sunday? Really? Back to the noise factor...I understand they can't control the residents that live on the course but some trees might help filter out the noise and keep kids from throwing water bottles onto the golf course. This happened on the 2nd hole while we were playing. In the middle of swinging, all of the sudden there is a water bottle plowing into the fairway. Nice...\\nOver all the course was just awful. The worst I have played in the valley. From the huge dirt patches throughout, to the dead sod all around that has been neglected to the dried up lake beds for sand traps, it just doesn't add up.\\nWhen you decide to put your golf course on Groupon and try to get business I would hope that you would make sure your course is in WAY better condition. We will not be going back. It's unfortunate because the course has potential. The buildings are updated, and the infrastructure is nice. Heck the bathroom on the course was one of the nicest.

Keep in mind, this review is for brunch, so I don't know what the rest of their menu is like.  Brunch was tapas style, so servings were small, which allowed us to try so many different dishes.  And each dish had like a lil twist.  There were shrimp and grits, steak and eggs, eggs benedict.  I know, sounds like standard brunch fair right? But it was so good y'all, trust me.\\n\\nThere were like 10 flavors of bottomless mimosa, and I think I got to like 6 before I was like ok it's too early for me to get drunk off champagne.  But all were good except the cucumber one, that one was weird.  Rest were quite tasty.\\n\\nService: two thumbs up.  Dangit I can't remember our servers name, but she was knowledgeable of the menu, friendly, attentive, she gave good suggestions, and was all around great lady.

I heard good things about Planet Hollywood and wanted to give it a try. \\n\\nFirst of all, this place is DARK...even for Vegas.

{"trgt": "I have stayed in the Luxor many years ago and it was actually pretty nice. I knew the place had gotten old and only booked the room because I was in town for a convention at the MGM which is right across the street. I was prepared for the room to be average and not so nice so my low scores are not based on that. I wasnt expecting a 5 star stay, but what happened over the course of the week was disgusting and so wrong! \\n\\nFirst of all Ammenities: \\n- Rooms are old and out dated\\n - Furiture was scratched and broken in some places\\n -Bedding was comparible to a motel six \\n- NO WIFI! \\n- No central A/C so the room doesnt get cold.\\n\\nok now lets move on to the real reason I will NEVER stay here and will warn everyone I know not to. My Macbook Laptop was stolen from my room while I was out all day. I left my room at 7:00am when I returned at 11pm the laptop was gone. I searched everywhere before calling to file a complaint. They sent up a security officer who had me fill out a voluntary statement.\\n\\n Once that was done I realized I had no way to charge my cell phone, because I was using the outlet on my laptop. I went to the front desk and asked for a manager. I explained to him that my laptop had been stolen from my room and I had just filled out a report, but that I have no way to charge my cell phone and was hoping the hotel could let me borrow one for the remainder of my stay. The manager was so rude!! He told me that I could go to security and see if they have a charger in lost and found, why would they give me someone elses property! I told him I am not familiar with the hotel can he show me where to go. He pointed into the casino floor, never even looked up. I told him I couldnt believe after being stolen from in their hotel that he was not more willing to assist me in which he replied \\\" look lady if I had a charger in this drawer id give it to you, but i dont. Itd not my fault you cant charge your phone.\\\" WOW you would think he could have at least walked me over to security to try to help me. \\n\\nI eventually found the security station. They told me they have a charger but I would have to plug it in and wait for it to charge! 6 hour wait and its 2 in the morning. I told her I have to get up at 5am and cannot wait, so she suggested I leave my phone there. WHAT! after my property was just stolen! I ended up having to buy a $45 charger from the gift shop. \\n\\nOn top of that when I went back to my room to get into bed the sheets had chocolate stains all over. I called the front desk who told me they could have a sheet change done in 90 mins. I told her I could not wait that long as I needed to get some rest and had a big day the next day is there any one who could come sooner. She replied that they have limited house keeping and I shouldnt expect so much, there isnt anything I can do. WOW! \\n\\nThe next day my husband came to join me, when he arrived he came to the valet. The valet told him the lot was full and he couldnt not park. I was on the phone with him walking to greet him- my husband said I am a guest here is there another place I can park myself. The valet said no this is your only option, but if you give me $100 I'll work it out for you. I told my husband do not give him any money I will be right there with a manager. While I was waiting for the manager the valet was telling my husband you better move your car or I'll make you move it. My husband replied to him trust me you dont want me to get out of this car..when the manager came to help me he told me that there is self parking around the back....WHY did the valet tell us that....loh yeah because he is trying to STEAL $100 from us!!! The manager did nothing and told us he has to side with his staff. \\n\\nAt the end of the day nothing was done about any of this. The manager we spoke to at check out was rude and unhelpful I asked them to refund the room and was actually asked why would we do that? was there anything you didnt get that was promised? WOW how about common customer service and all of my belongings with me during check out. \\n\\nAlso regarding my laptop I have called risk management over 10 times and no one has called me back. I finally got a hold of someone yesterday who told me the only person who used a key besides myself was the maid. They said she told them she didnt take it so the investigation is closed. \\n\\nThere are so many great places to stay in Vegas the Luxor is not one of them.

The Original Wineburger ($5.75), one-third pound of certified Angus Beef, was cooked perfectly medium and oozing with cheddar cheese. Each juicy bite was hinted with wine, which gave the burger a slightly sweet edge.\\n\\nThe Super Wineburger ($8.75) is a two-third pound version of the original, though after a few bites I realized that they forgot to use wine on this one.

{"trgt": "I wish that I could rate this place zero stars or negative stars.  \\n\\nHere are just a few things that I did not like: \\n\\n1) Room's cleanliness: Room was very dirty. I found a Revlon makeup container in the bedroom floor. So, it was evident that the housekeepers didn't vacuum. I am a male and I don't use makeup. My wife doesn't use Revlon, so I know it wasn't something that fell out of my suitcase. \\n\\nThe bathroom was, in their own manager's words, \\\"disgusting.\\\"  I found lots of hair on the bathroom floor (obviously, no one even attempted to clean this). I also found pubic hairs on the tub and sink.  Let's just sat that I shave and there is no chance that the body hair of any kind was mine.  Several \\\"clean\\\" towels had hairs on them, and the hairs were from different people (hairs were red, blond, black, brown, etc.). \\n\\nUntil this trip, I had never complained at a hotel ever in my entire life. I used to clean bathrooms and gyms as a college student, so I know how tough it is to get the job done in the time allotted. Also, I am a very forgiving person. I don't expect my room to be as clean as an operating room. On Saturday morning, I went to the manager and complained. He listened to me, and expressed his apologies. He also said that the hair in the floor was \\\"disgusting\\\" and \\\"unacceptable.\\\" He offered me a free buffet ticket.  That's it.  A free buffet ticket...wait for it...for two people.  He basically accused me of lying. \\n\\nI got the sense that the manager thought I had invited some women into my room because he asked me several times if I was alone (and, I was). I suppose the issue was that I didn't complain shortly after checking in. Well, I basically fell asleep as soon as I got to my room on Friday night and I didn't wake up until Saturday morning. I complained as soon as I noticed the hair. \\n\\nLesson learned: check your room ASAP after entering and report any dissatisfactory conditions immediately. \\n\\nThe housekeeping manager came to my room later on Saturday and checked on my room. That was a nice gesture and made me feel like they actually cared a little. \\n\\n2) Check-in Process: I arrived around 4:00 PM on a Friday. The line to check in was very long, and it took about 30 minutes to get to the desk to check in. \\n\\n3) Ambiance: There were a lot of people in the hotel promoting various dinner specials, show specials, etc. I don't want to deal with that inside my hotel. The Strip is one thing, but come on: I don't want chaos inside my hotel. I go inside to get some peace. The hotel's crowd included a lot of country-Western \\\"macho\\\" guys, which I can't tolerate being around. I also prefer to be around a little bit higher class of person than was at Treasure Island. I don't like being threatened at a bar for accidentally bumping into someone who was blocking the only walking path in Gilley's bar. \\n\\n4) Wi-fi internet not free: It's a little ridiculous that hotels charge for wi-fi. At least it was fast wi-fi.", "beginning": "I wish that I could rate this place zero stars"}

He then argued that the address I had given him was not an address he had in his system from prior deliveries there... Kept putting me on hold (about 5 times) to check with his manager... I ask him if he HAD the address, why was he insistent that I give him what he already knows... He said, \\\"you know what?! We're not delivering to you as you are outside our delivery area!\\\". I was in the process of speaking when he intrupided me to tell me this. I had found another address for the hospital and was trying to give that one to him. He continuely over spoke me... He was rude! He was unprofessional. He was condesceding. I was willing to drive to freaken pick up the order although it's stupid not to drive one more block to deliver... Actually less than!

The waiter was pleasant enough and sent an assistant manager who advised he'd get some less fatty brisket. This 3rd replacement was better with less fat. My complaint to the general manager was handled very poorly with no accommodation.  This was followed with a complaint to the chef - owner who responded with no emotion.

{"trgt": "I was excited to have El Hefe open on Mill since it's closer to my house than the Scottsdale location and I love their margaritas.  I was extremely disappointed with the service, I didn't expect it to be fantastic but thought it would at least be decent. \\n\\nI gave this place 2 tries, my first visit was the 2nd week it was open.  My boyfriend and I sat at the bar near the front patio, we tried to order a few of the margaritas and the bartender told us she didn't have the ingredients to make those.  We asked what she could make us, she said 'pretty much just a regular margarita.'  The main bar is about 10 steps away, I was thinking she would at least either get ingredients from them to make the drinks, or have them make it and she would bring it over.  After going with the regular margaritas the bartender had the ingredients for, we finished and wanted to ordered a bottled beer.  The bartender explained she didn't have the beer we wanted at this bar.  I guess she didn't want to go get the bottles from the other bar or stock her bar properly so she could be prepared for customers.  We ended up closing the tab and leaving.  \\n\\nThe scottsdale location has a side bar as well kinda in the back, and that bar always seems to be stocked to make all the margaritas and more from the menu.  That being said, I was kinda shocked with the laziness of this bartender, especially since we were 2 of the 4 people at the bar.  \\n\\nMy 2nd visit was Valentines day 2014.  My boyfriend and I went to get a drink at El Hefe before dinner since the basketball game was on.  We went to the main bar this time and waited in plane view for about 10-15 minutes to be asked for our order.  As I was standing there, I noticed the bartenders were not taking anyones order from the bar, they were mainly paying attention to the tickets coming in from the restaurant.  I found this weird, especially since people at the bar were trying to order drinks but couldn't get the attention from the bartenders.  I got to order drinks and after they were made they were very good.  We finished the first drinks and my bf ordered another of the same drink, this time his drink tasted NOTHING like the previous one, it was kind of gross like it was missing a main ingredient.  After he paid for that drink, a few minutes later he noticed he didn't get his card back so he told the bartender.  The bartender asked for his last name as if he was going to look for the card and instead proceeded to go to the next customer and take a drink order ...I waited after he made the new customer their drink, to see if he would look for the card, he didn't he just proceeded to make more drinks.  We flagged down another bartender who made the awful drink to look behind the bar for the card, she did a real swift look and didn't come back to tell us if she found or didn't find the card. INSTEAD, she proceeded to take her purse and leave the bar,i guess to go on her break. WOW! We had planned to go to dinner afterwards and my bf was going to buy.  Turns out he couldn't buy or go to dinner if he didn't have his card.  So I went to the hostess this time, she took down all my information and i asked her to go look behind the bar.  I told her I know its there and we need to go to dinner but can't without my boyfriends card.  She seemed sincere and i watched her go up to the first bartender we tried to get help from.  They exchanged some words and he just continued making drinks for the tickets from the restaurant instead of even attempting to look for my bf's card.   \\n\\nWe ended up leaving and going home since we were getting no where with the El Hefe staff and didn't have card to pay for dinner.  (If I was aware this was going to happen I would have brought money so we could go to dinner, but I didn't plan for El Hefe's staff to be completely rude and incompetent of helping a customer).\\n\\nThe next morning my boyfriend calls El Hefe when they opened and asked if they had his card.  What do you know...they had his card and it was BEHIND THE BAR THE WHOLE TIME! Thank you to the El Hefe staff for not even bothering to look for my boyfriends card on Valentine's day.  Thank you for ruining Valentine's Day night that was supposed to be fun and simple.

Even though I ate their barbecue a few years ago and wasn't impressed, I figure it's time to try it again.\\n\\nWe went in on a Saturday afternoon, and the cavernous room was just about empty.  Seriously.  This huge room - outfitted to be reminiscent of the old building - had one other table with customers.  We spent probably ten minutes talking to the cashier and were not interrupted.  After we sat down, another couple came in.  That may not be a good sign.  But it's for another discussion.\\n\\nI decided that I would order a combo plate so that I could taste the barbecue and the brisket.  I've actually had brisket (in Texas, to be fair) that I loved, and I really would like to find someone in Charlotte who can do it justice, so I keep trying.\\n\\nThe brisket?  Nah.  It just isn't worth it, so don't bother.  The pulled pork is okay, but it doesn't have much flavor.  They do have some sauces that you can add, and they are okay, but nothing special.  The thing that really gets me is that their mac and cheese really has potential, it has consistency just like my grandmother used to make.  But again, it has no flavor.  It seems they used a bunch of actual cheese, rather than just using velveeta or something, but no mustard or anything else to give it flavor.  Shame, really.\\n\\nMaybe I'll check back again in another couple of years.", "beginning": "Elliot's recently moved to the old Meadowview steakhouse location (much,"}

The server obviously recognized the mistake and kept checking in with us and apologized for the unusually long wait, (did I mention the restaurant was half empty, I wonder why!) and she did offer to comp our coffee drinks.  But the infuriating part was when we finally complained to the manager because we could not figure out why the ridiculously long wait, she came over to our table, did not properly introduce herself, sat down and pointed to the man-held computer system and TOLD US we had only been waiting 15 minutes.  Really?!?  You're coming over to tell us how long we have been waiting???  It was so rude and disrespectful, she was trying to argue her point to us which clearly showed that the server did not put in our order immediately which is probably why the server apologized to us umpteen times!!!  It was the most ridiculous display of what NOT to do as a manager.  I have been in management and customer service for over 12 years and this was clearly a Management 101 mistake.  She never apologized or tried to rectify the situation, but when you come out to your customers in fighting mode you really cannot rectify that! \\n\\n Needless to say, unless this restaurant starts to provide better training to their managers and team members, or hires a new manager, we will NOT be coming back here again.", "beginning": "We went here for Mother's Day based on the positive"}

{"trgt": "We stopped by here prior to going to a Cirque show on our first night in Vegas.  I made reservations for 5 so I expected to have a table ready at that time.  Not the case, we waited about 10 minutes and we were told there was a option to dine indoors or 'outdoors' - at this point I said dining outdoors.  We were then told that the menus are different depending on where you sit and I still mentioned that outdoors was fine for the group.  We were seated and guess what - there was the 'other menu' that was only for the indoors guest.  I already started realizing their staff have NO idea what's going on and there isn't consistent communication between the owner and staff as to what should be communicated to guests.  But our night gets better...\\n\\nWe were seated and our waiter (whom we saw once and only once) asked to take our orders.  We were relatively quick in giving our orders to the waiter and he said he would put the order in.  We were given our bread and we munched on it as I checked the clock.  Dinner reservations were at 6pm (I always expect incompetence) and our show was at 9:30pm.  Well, this \\\"Spago\\\" place had us waiting for our meals for over 1 HOUR.  Meanwhile our unattentive, incompetent waiter AND owner did not even come by our table to explain to us what the issue was (if there was any issue).  Anybody in the restaurant business, or any business would say to keep an open line of communication with your customers so it APPEARS that you know what in the actual f*** is going on in the kitchen.  I understand being understaffed, or a kitchen rush, or whatever it may be but not a word from these two.  Nobody came by except the man who was very attentive to refilling our waters.  \\n\\nNow, once we received our food people were relatively happy, but one person was disgusted as the salmon was overcooked.  At that rate, we should've asked them to use the kitchen and cooked the meal ourselves. Seriously,  if anyone has to wait that long the food better be amazing and when everyone isn't happy it is a tremendous fail.  We heard all of the BS about about the food being handmade but explain to me how there was another table that came in WAY after us and had their food WAY before us.  And they weren't appetizers.  The manager of this restaurant didn't care but we wanted a business card so we can follow up with the general manager since they are a separate establishment - guess what? he didn't have any.  What manager doesn't have business cards on them? \\n\\nI wouldn't recommend you going here and I wouldn't recommend my enemy going here either.

It is run efficiently by capable, friendly staff who genuinely enjoy chef Aaron May's fun cooking and who know how to pour a drink.\\n\\nUp until this point in your life, you've likely never tried a deviled egg burger: a burger lovingly prepared with a smattering of delicious deviled egg, with a perfect bit of cheese all on a wonderful english muffin of sorts. This simple fact needs to be remedied: try one at your earliest convenience.\\n\\nIt will get everywhere, as the burger is too big for its britches, and the deviling helps not a bit with cleanliness, but the flavor is fantastic and thoroughly enjoyable.\\n\\nThe shrimp cocktail brings about a very few (four, I believe, in my case) enormous shrimp, but at roughly $2.25 a pop, I don't think I'd repeat, though the cocktail sauce is delightfully prepared and the shrimp are as big as your fist.\\n\\nThe bar is wonderful and eccentric, and on Tuesdays, you can attempt to stump Chef May. Though I haven't tried yet, it sounds like a world of fun in its own right. Better still, they pour heavy, which is good as the cocktails can run in the $7-$14 range.\\n\\nOverall, the atmosphere is subdued; you almost hope it'll be smoky each time you walk in. The stamped tin roof is fun and the penny-floor is a quirky touch in the men's bathroom. And don't forget to ask about Moby Dick. \\n\\nA good date place with a small but expertly prepared menu, but easily a $60 night for two if you each have a meal and two drinks.

The rooms are good, especially if you're in the suites.  Those are really nice.  HOWEVER, I have to say that the beds are terribly uncomfortable.  They're hard and so are the pillows.  I had shoulder and neck problems from them.  Also, check your pillows for possible bed bugs, as I met a woman in line for breakfast with bites all over her face from an unknown source - the last time I saw something like that it was bedbugs at a hostel.\\nThe cafe downstairs is nothing major.  Decent food at any hour.  Nothing special to speak of.  During the 12:30am hour service was slow and kind of unfriendly.  During the 10am hour it was speedy and friendly.

{"trgt": "Everything was perfect--the service, the timeliness, the atmosphere...\\n\\n...everything EXCEPT THE FOOD.\\n\\nI can't give a restaurant a good review if the food isn't good, especially at this price point. Here's the run-down:\\n\\nDRINKS: Okay, these were good. The Mulo Romano and Amore Amaro were probably highlights of the meal.\\n\\nWARM OLIVES: Fine. These were the highlight of the food, but the texture was a little mushy--not firm and fresh like olives should be. The orange peel garnish added a nice, unexpected element that made the dish more complex. Eat this part with the olives if you decide to order this.\\n\\nARANCINI: They were hard balls of bland, puffy, overcooked rice. Looking back on images that other people posted on Yelp of their Cento arancini, the kitchen must have also run out of cheese. Ours came with a light dusting of powdered parm rather than an ample melty layer of shredded cheese as is seen in another photo. \\n\\nSOURDOUGH WITH LOCAL BUTTER: They really play with words to make this starter sound romantic. 5 half-slices of bread come with a ball of butter in a little pool of olive oil. The flavors were one-note. It would have been nice to have salt and pepper grinders on the table so we could customize the dish ourselves. I understand that good restaurants don't offer salt and pepper on the table because the chef wants customers to experience each dish as he/she creates it, but everything else we had that night could have used some more seasoning.\\n\\nFRIED SQUID: Over-fried squid was rubbery. The romesco sauce was good, but it was the only source of flavor on the plate. The grilled lemons would have been a great touch if we were able to squeeze some juice out of the paper-thin slices.\\n\\nBLACK TAGLIATELLE: The pasta itself had a gluey, pasty texture that wasn't pleasant. I wondered if it was the squid ink, but after doing a little research post-visit, this wasn't the case. Our tagliatelle also didn't have much sauce, and what was there tasted like cream and not much else. Very bland. This was disappointing because so many Yelpers rave about this dish, and their photos show a nice golden sauce. \\n\\nAfter reading so many positive reviews, my man and I had greatly anticipated our visit here.

{"trgt": "IKEA can suck my LEKSVIK.\\n\\nEvery time I go to IKEA, I'm reminded why I hate it so much - and yet I keep returning. Just entering the store is like going on Mr. Toad's Wild Ride - once you enter, you can't leave until you've taken the entire tour through the maze of shitty Swedish furniture. They provide you with cheap shitty food, a place to crap or puke it out, and strategically placed seating so you can rest. They black out the windows so you have no sense of time as well. It's evil genius. \\n\\nI think it's absurd that people actually eat here - like they just accept that they are being held prisoner by an evil Swedish furniture factory. The cheap food is too cheap - it's gut-rot inducing and it pains me just to think about it. Hot Dogs and Meat Balls? Are you serious? You don't even know what kind of mystery meat it is - much less if it's even real meat... and you happily pay a buck like you're really sticking it to the man with your bargain meal. Gag me.\\n\\nJust like at Disneyland, people bring their fucking ugly kids here and allow them to run around free screaming like wild animals. Parents use their strollers as battering rams to make way through the crowd. Nobody in there has ever showered in their life. I sometimes suspect that everyone there is a paid extra - nobody is ever buying anything.\\n\\nThere are two ways to shop here: 1. Arrive having researched and read the catalog and have a specific list of things to buy. 2. Wander around aimlessly for 3 hours, pick up something that you kinda need and carry it around with you for another 3 hours, give up the moment you have the exit door in sight and leave your single pathetic item on a pallet of flat-pack deck chairs and bypass the checkout lines so you can taste freedom at last.\\n\\nIKEA furniture is cheap, but expensive. It looks nice from far away, but up close you can see that it's junk. Run your hand along any of their wood counter surfaces and you'll feel the warping. Have a look at any corner on any dresser and you'll see the finish peeling away. It's good for utility furniture or to fill out a guest bedroom or storage room or kids room, but unless you're a college kid - this furniture is garbage. To top it off, it's overpriced. \\n\\nThe only things worth buying here are lightbulbs and batteries (which honestly aren't that great) because they are cheap. Even their flatware is crap - it rusts... yes, it rusts. You're better off going to Tuesday Morning or Ross or even Target and picking up something nicer. Don't be fooled by the contemporary modern urban stylings - IKEA is overpriced crappy junk. It's not cheap because they flat pack and pass the savings on to you - it's cheap because it's junk. \\n\\nI have some IKEA dressers and I use them as DVD storage - they work fine, but I don't expect them to last forever. Their couches are all uncomfortable, their chairs are even worse. The beds are barely one step up from sleeping on the floor. Their kitchen and bathroom cabinets are awful - you'll be sorry if you remodel your rooms with this stuff. \\n\\nI like the look of IKEA - honestly, I do. I think it's a good concept and they have some really good style ideas. Nothing they sell is really well-made and assembly is required... considering what it is, it's overpriced. That said - you can find some decent stuff here. Inexpensive poorly-crafted furniture has its applications.", "beginning": "IKEA can suck my LEKSVIK.\\n\\nEvery time I go to IKEA,"}

We went last night, Sunday, and got there about 8 pm (they closed at 9 pm).\\n\\nFirst we walked in, was not sure where to go since it was out first time.  Someone walked by and said the hostess will be back in a few minutes.  So we waited..and waited.  About 15 minutes later a hostess arrived.  We asked to be seated outside since it was beautiful out.  She was annoyed that the table she sat us at was directly against a bench which I kept hitting my elbow on.  We asked to move (there were a lot of tables) which annoyed her even more.  About 15 minutes later our server showed up (granted now the close in 30 minutes).  We asked for a cup of ice and lemons for our water multiple times...never saw those the whole meal.

Waited around for about 10 minutes then got buzzed and seated. The place was totally NOT packed. There were probably 5 open tables and no one being seated. A few of the tables still had a bunch of trash on and i didn't see anyone going to clean it. \\n\\nOnce we were seated we took a look at the menu. We decided to just stick with water for our drinks since we were getting a sundae. We opted for the Jackpot Sundae at 14 bucks because it was a combo of chocolate (which my boyfriend likes) and strawberry (which I like). \\n\\nWaited waited waited. It literally took them 15 to 20 minutes to come to us and they never even took our drink orders yet. We were seriously on the verge of leaving. There was a table of 3 next to us that came in 10 minutes after we did and we could tell they were waiting too. We decided that if they took their orders first, we were just going to up and leave.Tthey didn't, so they got us to stay for a while longer, but they did take their order RIGHT AFTER ours. \\n\\nWe were never asked if we needed anything or how we were doing, the waitress never even refilled our waters. \\n\\nWe waited about 20 more minutes for the sundae. It was freakin' ridiculous! I have a feeling they must be like this all the time. We noticed 4 cups of french fries in the kitchen that was just sitting there for 10 minutes, I hope they don't just give that to people when it gets ordered. \\n\\nThe sundae finally came. Half melted. Of course, they brought out everyone else's order at the same time. Are they really that lazy? They just had to wait to finish everyone's order from different tables to bring it out at the same time instead of making a few trips? The sundae's were seriously dripping because they must've been sitting and melting for a while. \\n\\nThe only thing they managed to bring in a very speedy manner was the check, of course. She pretty much gave that to us right after she handed over the sundae. So annoying. I should've ordered a soda or something just so she'd have to take it back and change it. \\n\\nThe sundae was good, but it definitely doesn't make up for the horrendous service.

I would say this was my favorite dish, wish the size was larger. $9 for 7 small peppers, 5 chunks of cheese and 7 almonds.

Meh. Very sparse toppings. Flavors didn't go together as well as I had hoped.\\n-Chorizo Sausage Pizza: Also had tomatoes, and I forgot what else. Taste was slightly above average, but again, very sparse toppings. I think there were probably 7 or 8 very small pieces of sausage on the entire pizza.\\n\\nService was mediocre at best.

As things turned out, my experience is NOT an isolated incident with this business if you research other travel sites. \\n\\nMany of our family members booked a mini family vacation here for a July weekend several months in advance DIRECTLY from their web site. After getting a confirmation and putting down a deposit($230/night) for our reservation, we thought that everything was set. What else could go wrong?\\n\\nWhen we arrived around 3pm check in time after tired 9hr drive. My heart sank after they informed me that we no longer have a room because they were overbooked(was a busy weekend, boxing event). Now why on earth would you continue to book people for the hotel rooms when you know you ran out of rooms!!! Isn't it suppose to be first come first serve?  When you don't have enough rooms to rent out for a particular day, aren't you suppose to stop booking more people! \\n\\nAs I later learned, we weren't the only people that have this problem on that day. I overhear many other guests that were just as pee off  as we were after getting bump from the hotel. \\n\\nAfter pleading with them to provide us a room(didn't care if its down or up scale) so we can stay with the family without staying 3 miles away from the strip, they still wouldn't give us our room. All they told us was that they were sold out and the typical customer service talk. The only thing they did was give us some taxi money and transferred our stay to their sister hotel Mirage(also owned by MGM) for a complimentary stay and refunded us the deposit. \\n\\nIn hindsight, I suspect that they bumped us because there were more people willing to pay for a higher rate that busy weekend. So obviously if they pay more, that'd be more $$ for the hotel. Just weeks before I went, I often checked the price of the rooms and noticed that the rate gone up by 50%+. So it sounds to me that the highest bidder wins.  \\n\\nWhat ever happen to  business integrity? Back in the days when you get a confirmation after making a deposit, its pretty much a done deal that you'll get your room.   If you don't mind rolling the dice, book this place at your own risk because of a confirmation don't mean anything.\\n\\nIn the future, I'll have 2nd thought about staying at any MGM properties.

{"trgt": "Valentine's evening 2013, my wonderful husband surprised me with dinner at this restaurant as we had never been to either the Stratosphere or the restaurant before. I was so looking forward to a wonderful evening with one of my bestest friends and my wonderful husband. Unfortunately the experience as a whole left a bad taste in my mouth. It was a combination of the Management of the facility as well as another diner in the restaurant that honestly I wish I was able to confront for ruining such a wonderful evening.\\n\\nWithout letting that situation put a bias on my review of their food, it was mediocre at best and seriously over-priced for what we had tried to consume before being rudely interupted by the manager. It seems that one of the other diners near us were offended by our laughter and enjoyment, enthusiasm for being together, and certain words that were spoken at my table. The manager then approached our table, looked at me directly and asked that we refrain from these activities immediately. Now please keep in mind I spent well over 200 dollars for dinner and had not even been served as yet. I promptly requested to know whom had made such a request of us, as I intended to embarass and humiliate them as they had done to me. Maybe not the best approach but honestly - who in their right mind is so narcassistic to believe that they are allowed to go out in Public then mandate that the Public behave in the way they deem they should? If you are so easily offended by others, stay at home and don't ever leave.\\n\\nBack to dinner, I gathered my things, my 25 dollar valentine's day dinner picture, my BFF and left my husband to deal with getting our dinner to go. We had split some of the meal with my friend so he had 2 cards and some cash he wanted to give towards the dinner with the intent of giving cash to the waitress after the transaction as a tip (we prefer tipping in cash as we believe the servers are not taxed on this and get to keep more of it - if that makes sense). I am not real clear on what the cash portion my husband provided was for as I think he had wanted to get change from it but it seems the waitress took it upon herself not to return 20 dollars of that cash. Funny, she was going to receive a much larger tip than 20 dollars as she was excellent, it was her manager that was the jerk, but just taking the money and not returning it, allowed us to assume thats all she thought she deserved and we did not offer anything more. \\n\\nAll in all, as I indicated, the food really wasn't all that compared to other places we have been to with similar offerings. The price was not fitting of the quality of food, the service was excellent but that last little action was uncalled for. The manager needs a class in people skills and the only real redeeming quality this place has is that it sits at the top of the Stratosphere, spins and provides a nice view of the strip when your table finally gets there. If it was just an observation deck with a bar it could have been a much better place to go. Overall I was pretty bummed that this place seems to get a lot of hype but really is disappointing in the end.", "beginning": "Valentine's evening 2013, my wonderful husband surprised me with dinner"}

I was there on their opening night a few years ago and while we were all super excited for a more upscale Asian place (and the first sushi place in the downtown area, for that matter), the restaurant had a lot of kinks to work out with delivery of food (particularly getting sushi before hot items) and just service in general. However, we were all pretty happy with the food. While the sushi wasn't the freshest we've had in Arizona, the rolls were well executed and the hot food was enjoyable. We particularly liked the red miso soup with tofu.  \\n\\nFast forward a few years and Moira has definitely worked out the service kinks. In fact, when my husband and I were there last Saturday night, we had some of the best service we've had in a long time. Our server, Heather C, was really attentive, with prompt drink refills and quick delivery of everything we asked for. The order of the food was all perfect as well, with the items we requested all coming out in the right order. \\n\\nI still don't think Moira's food is the best around, and I definitely have to give nearby Sens first prize for hot Asian entrees downtown, but it's solid and goes up a notch during HH, when much of it is half priced. I also give the nod to Sens for cocktails, as theirs are sweet/exotic while still packing a punch. I can't say the same for Moira's, which are all sugary sweet.

Restaurant itself is located in the upper lobby of a glass and steel building housing Mellon Bank and the local offices of Jones Day; would've been a hot prom date destination for a rich kid in a John Hughes movie. Service is inattentive and lackadaisical. I ordered a glass of wine that was tantalizingly described as 'unknown' on the menu. Wine by the glass is frequently a burn, since you never know how long ago the bottle was opened, but at a place which boasts of its carefully curated wine list, it's an enticing dare.

And it is right across the street from Bad Daddy's (used to be Big Daddy's), so you are competing with those patrons, as well as people that live on that street, for parking. 2) the pricing; which seems a bit high to me ($160 for partial cut and color).

{"trgt": "So I have had it with the lousy software updates, with each new rendition of iOS, from 5 to 7, getting worse and worse, as well as introducing new bugs that are not resolved. \\n\\nIn total, I have replaced my iPhone 4 once, and my iPhone 4S TWICE, all within a year of purchase. Usually its some sort of battery charging issue, it goes like this, the phone gets REALLY HOT the day before the battery fails, and very soon after that, it no longer holds a charge. It may stay at one percent, maybe it drops from 100 down to 0 in two hours or less. All THREE of the 4-Series iPhones did this to me. And it usually happens right after a hotfix patch.\\n\\nIn particular, I have had a bad experience with THIS Apple Store. In my final iPhone 4S fiasco, I went back to the Apple Store to get it replaced because its still within the range of one year since purchase. Everything went smoothly, supposedly. \\n\\nThen on my way out with my refurbished replacement model, I was immediately stopped by two of the male Mac geniuses that sort of look alike (they refer each other as \\\"Clark Kents\\\" as some sort of inside joke). They told me to follow them back to the Genius Bar, only for me to realize that apparently I am accused as a thief as they sternly questioned me about \\\"Where was the old iPhone?\\\".  Only then, did the stocky blonde girl (the Concierge), managed to show them that she had it, AFTER I started YELLING at the staff that \\\"the blonde girl has it\\\". She FUCKING LOST THE OLD IPHONE that I gave to her in exchange for the replacement! If I hadn't made the Geniuses drag her ass back out of the break room in the back, I probably would have been arrested for a false felony grand larceny charge. \\n\\nAnd then it got worse, on my embittered way out of the store, NEW replacement phone in hand, the Geniuses actually followed my ass out profusely saying fake apologies. \\n\\n\\nI no longer am one of those Apple fans. There is no amount of empty \\\"Sorry's\\\" and fake smiles that can draw me back. \\n\\n\\nHere is another story, of a different Las Vegas Apple Store experience.\\n\\nMy MacBook Pro, which I bought 3 years ago, is in need of a battery replacement according to the diagnostic tools that its been warning me with. \\n\\nBut, given how I was treated at this store, and the Town Square Location (they aided a thief who stole this very MacBook in reformatting and deleting the Undercover Mac software before selling it to a pawn shop, and I had to call Metro's Property Crimes Division to use the personal information I acquired through screenshots by Undercover to get it back), I refuse to purchase or request services or support from any Apple Retailer. \\n\\nIn fact, I even wrote a negative Yelp review of the Town Square location upon discovery of my stolen MacBook (through Wifi-Router GPS screenshots) a few years ago. I was complimented by many other Yelpers for my \\\"slick detective work\\\" before it was mysteriously deleted months later by Yelp. I included screenshots of a thin caucasian male Apple employee that was reformatting my formerly stolen Mac, this evidence was also taken by my Undercover Mac software. \\n\\nI am considerable getting some sort of Android device as replacement. I realized I should have snapped much earlier, but my older brother is some sort of die-hard Apple fan that really doesn't want to let Steve Job's dream go. \\n\\nI however, am very willing to burn bridges. Especially built by those who turn on not just me, but their crazed consumers. You can Google it, there was a lawyer who sued a Apple Store, search for \\\"Michael Deverett\\\" from Toronto over a plethora of stolen Apple products. He won surprisingly. \\n\\n\\n\\nRight now, I am digging around my laptop to see if I can find those old screenshot photos I have that implicated the Town Square location. But instead of submitting THAT along with photos on Yelp, which would surely be deleted, I am going to put it up on Google Maps.\\n\\n\\nUpdate:\\n\\nFound some of the implicating evidence for the stolen laptop incident years ago at Town Square. However, I remembered that it wasn't all the screenshots. It may be in my external HDD back at home, i'll check again when I get back. \\n\\nNote: \\n\\nIf these reviews get deleted, I am merely going to repost backups onto Google Maps instead.", "beginning": "So I have had it with the lousy software updates,"}

We asked why it had taken so long, and she said, \\\"It's only been 45 minutes since I put it in.\\\" We replied, \\\"But we've been waiting for almost 1.5 hours.\\\" She repeated that the order hadn't been in that long instead of apologizing and explaining the hold up.  The table next to us was then served (after waiting for ages) and she said, \\\"They were here first...obviously.\\\" and then walked off.  We hadn't even said a word about the other table when she made that rude comment.\\n\\nAt that point we went to the manager to complain.  He apologized and about 15 minutes later it was obvious our waitress had been spoken to. She said, \\\"I'm sorry for the wait and we'd like to offer free dessert. should I bring you a chocolate fondue?\\\"  We said no and we would like to figure out our own dessert. She made another rude comment at that point. Something like, \\\"you *don't* want the fondue.  Fine.\\\" One person in our party couldn't partake because it had taken so long to get her one side order that she then had to leave to make another engagement.  \\n\\nIt also took another 15 minutes to get our check and we tried flagging down anyone.

When I say tap room I mean a small room with a table a few chairs, a couch and a tv where they keep 3 different flavors of Kombucha on tap.  If it is your first time trying or you are a seasoned vet who home brews there own it is a great place to learn about kombucha and the way lenny boy brews theirs.   The owners are super friendly and certainly love sharing about the product that they pour.  You are welcome to sample all of the flavors on tab or just get a glass of one or even buy a growler to take some home (I now have 2 of my own cause I have become Kombuchalioc) all for reasonable prices.  They are now certified organic and use all north carolina ingrediants (unless unavailable in our great state).  This is also a great product for anyone doing a raw diet as they cold brew their tea.  I have only been here during the winter but there have been talks that as the weather begins to warm up they will be having live music and more outside in their parking lot which will make for a great relaxing afternoon.

{"trgt": "I think you need to consider the target audience for the Palms in order to truly appreciate it.  To give you an idea, let me explain my view of the archetypal Vegas casinos:\\n  =  Bellagio is catering to the 50+ crowd with the classic styling and the reserved elegance\\n  =  Venetian is great for those in their 40s looking for a lot of variety, or those with families\\n  =  Wynn is luxurious yet modern, perfect for those in their 30s\\n  =  Palms is all marketing hype and youthful abandon, designed to appeal to those in their 20s (or those who think they are still in their 20s)\\n\\nIf you agree with the above, then you'll agree that the Palms does a great job of filling a very important role in the Vegas casino cornucopia.\\n\\nThere are bright colors and lots of action.  It's fairly small (the casino is tiny compared to the mega-resorts), but the new Fantasy Tower almost doubles capacity while adding a new level of excitement.\\n\\nThe rooms in the Fantasy Tower are all brand new, and they've been designed with the metro crowd in mind - very modern, lots of dark woods (think W Hotel or THEhotel).  But the real reason to consider the Palms are the new clubs - Moon and the Playboy Club.\\n\\nThe new Playboy Club is an attempt to take away from the prime targets of THEhotel and the Wynn - young (but not too young) professionals.  The table games in the Playboy Club start at $50 a hand, so you aren't going to get your typical frat boy or sorority sister spilling their Bud Light on you.  The dealers are even more attractive than their profiles on the website, and it's a very dark room, giving it a distinct feel from normal casinos.  There's a $20 cover ($40 on weekends), so it's fairly steep if you don't have a host.  But the Playboy Club is connected to Moon, so you really get 2 clubs for the price of 1.\\n\\nPROS:\\n- Great rooms for the price (the Palms is usually cheaper than hotels on the Strip)\\n- It's on Flamingo Rd, so it's off the Strip and has extremely easy freeway access (perfect for the LA crowd or people with rentals)\\n- Table games generally have lower limits - it's not unusual to find $10 tables even on weekends\\n\\nCONS:\\n- It's not walkable to any other resort, so you need a car or time to take cabs\\n- Although there isn't a conference center in the hotel, the Palms is often sold out - big games, holidays, etc.\\n\\nBEST OF DREW - Vegas-Style!\\n- Best place to stay if price is no object: Four Seasons\\n- Best place to stay for a bachelor party: Palms\\n- Best place to stay for a bachelorette party: Venetian\\n- Best pool area: Mandalay Bay\\n- Best place for a couples getaway: THEhotel at Mandalay Bay", "beginning": "I think you need to consider the target audience for"}

{"trgt": "I rescued my ball of canine fluff (Harley) from the Humane Society two years ago. What I didn't know was that when I adopted him, they decided to neuter him before I took him home. When I went to pick him up Harley had a brand spanking new cone around his neck. So came the search for a veterinarian stat and I needed one who could be trusted to take top notch care of this mischievous dog. \\n\\nI learned quickly that a dog is expensive and especially with medical bills, shots, office visits...and that's just hitting on the basics. As I was visiting the Petsmart one day, I came across the Bandfield Pet Hospital conveniently located inside the store. I decided to begin chatting with them to see about pricing and they told me about their amazing deal. For between $25 and $35 a month, they offer a service where you get unlimited office visits, several shots, an annual dental cleaning and many more benefits for your animal. I cannot tell you how many times this service has come to the rescue for me. \\n\\nI absolutely love the Bandfield staff. Harley has spent his fair share of time in the doctor's office and every time he visits, the staff is extremely friendly and nice. They always get Harley in and out quickly. The vets know what they're doing and they take great care of the animals. After a visit, Harley always leaves happy and refreshed and normally with a clean bill of health. \\n\\nThe greatest part about Bandfield is that they are conscious of the economy and know they don't push unnecessary medications or products just to make money. They really do look out for the customer, both canine and human, so for that I am a forever fan of Bandfield! I think I can speak for Harley as well.", "beginning": "I rescued my ball of canine fluff (Harley) from the"}

{"trgt": "Went there on June 2012, and this horrible dinner is still seared in my mind & it was so disappointing because I planned our entire anniversary trip around this dinner. The most ahhhmazing part was when the car rolled up to the villa and the gates parted and than you are ushered into this plush, decadent restaurant. I should have known something was up since it was so easy to get reservation. We ordered the Menu A $250 per person. It was so bad that after the third course, my BF said he had enough and wanted to go eat something that's edible, but being Chinese I insisted we trudge on through as to not let food go to waste. The alcohol drink we ordered was nasty too. \\n\\nShort Review: Save your money, don't go here! Unremarkable food, paired with bad service. \\n\\nLong Review:\\nHere's what we ordered:\\n\\n1A) Green Asparagus...What a joke, anybody could have made it, no creativity to it.\\n1B) Spiced Lobster...My fave dish that night, but I'm partial to lobster.\\n\\n2A) Green Pea Cream Soup...Good, but not memorable.\\n2B) Light Daikon soup...Good, but not memorable. \\n\\n3A) Pan Fried Sea Bass...Fish was fresh, but not memorable. (A running theme of Robuchon.)\\n3B) Grilled Spiny Lobster...Came out cold. I asked the Waiter, if this is normal, he said he will check with the kitchen and redo it. When he came back with the new dish, he made a jeering remark to the gist of, \\\"Next time, don't take so long to take photos.\\\" WTF? Taking a couple of shots is not long enough to turn a dish cold.\\n\\nThan came the longest wait in the world for the fourth course. WE WAITED ALMOST AN HOUR FOR THE NEXT COURSE. Nobody came to apologize. There is no way that they didn't know about this because an integral part of fine dining is the timing of the dishes of when they are served. \\n \\n4A) Roasted duck...Okay.\\n4B) Beef cheeks...It was very tender, but the sauce was average. \\n\\nThe Mashed Potatoes. It was ahhhmazing. If this was the only course served, than Joel deserves 5 stars. Just give me a bucket of this and I am a happy camper.  \\n\\n5) Instead of Cheese Course we requested a substitute and they gave us the Risotto of Soybeans Sprouts. It was so salty...inedible. At that time, I was too afraid to say anything, lest I get another reprimand from the waiter. The waiter didn't even bother asking why we didn't finish the course. \\n\\n6A) La Fraise: Nasty tasting, served in a tacky serve ware. \\n6B) Le Chocolat: Also nasty, and tacky looking, why is there peacock feathers surrounding it?\\n\\nThan while we are eating our desserts, strangely they appeared with a cake, say happy anniversary, than walked off. Nice gesture, but the entire event was strange.  They will serve you a slice and the rest of the cake is thrown away. What a waste.\\n\\nAt the end of the meal, they roll out this beautiful dessert cart and tell you choose whatever mignardises you want. However, you are not allowed to take any of it to go. Huh? What kind of policy is this, I never had happened to me at a fine dining establishment. By that time, after this long drawn ordeal, I'm tired, my BF pissed. I randomly chose a few to try, but still you wouldn't want to take these home, even if you could. \\n\\nVerdict: Save your time and money and go splurge elsewhere.", "beginning": "Went there on June 2012, and this horrible dinner is"}

I like one of the three dipping sauces, and my wife liked a different one. When the waitress asked if we liked it, my wife indicated it was greasy and chewy. She apologized, but not really convincingly.\\n\\nFor entrees, I had the garlic shrimp tacos and my wife had the \\\"Tia's Enchiladas\\\" with spinach and cheese. My tacos were 3 small tacos with a decent amount of shrimp, cilantro, lettuce, and a pineapple salsa. They weren't bad, but were not very garlicy. My wife's enchiladas were good, nothing special. The ever-present sides of refried beans were typical of the variety, and the rice was well done with good flavor. Contrary to some other reviews, I would have called the plate sizes ordinary and not \\\"huge\\\".\\n\\nFor desert, my wife and I were going to split the banana epanadas with brandy caramel, but asked for it to be served without the brandy, as my wife has a severe alcohol allergy. The server checked with the manager and said they could do it, but that the caramel would lose a lot of its flavor without the brandy, and said it all burned off in the cooking. Well, from experience, my wife and I know it isn't true (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_common_misconceptions#Food_and_cooking), so we asked for it anyway.\\n\\nThen the server went to place the order and the cooks said the brandy was pre-mixed with the caramel.

Had two back-to-back horrible business deals with this Chapman Autoplex and will not, I repeat, WILL NOT, ever be back. I got cornholed bigtime on my last Dodge in 2003. Me and a couple other co-workers bought from a sneaky and unscrupulous sales woman named Kim Chartier back in 98 or so and I should have learned back then not to come back to this dealership. All of us got screwed in so many ways that it will take me two hours to state what happened. Years later, we still joke about this dealership and how bad we got it. My friend Debbie L bought two or three used vehicles from Kim C and she almost needed therapy when she realized how bad she got screwed, and she could have saved alot of money buying from someone else.I turned in a leased car back to them in 2003 (dont ever lease-sales reps make more commission on leases) therefore I was talked into one when I could have bought the car for $10 more a month. Costly mistake.  And before my lease on my Dodge Neon ended and I still had another payment left, they talked me into ending my lease a month early so i can get sold another Dodge-well they were supposed to make my last lease payment for me and of course, they didn't, and I got stuck with two payments for one month. Also, my interest rate was almost a point higher than I was quoted over the phone-when I went to sign the Chrysler Financial papers, the sales manager was no where to be found, and someone else was left in charge of it. When I confronted the sales manager the next day,  he said I could have free car detailing for the entire time I owned the car!! What good is this when I am not coming back??  I should have walked when the interest rate was higher than he told me over the phone but but I needed a car, was in a bind,  and wanted this horrible experience over with. I was also sold a useless extended warranty that I could have negotiated down in price, but once again, the gal that sold me this made her money and thats all that matters.  After a couple more hiccups with the paperwork, and another issue with my turned in leased car, I called to complain to the head manager, Johnny Lemke- what a jerk, very rude to me, and basically said it wasnt his problem and if I didnt get anything in writing, they won't honor it.I will never buy a Dodge again, never buy an extended warranty-they are a scam and don't cover anything, and I will never deal with this dealership again.  After my experience with them and some issues with my turned in leased vehicle, I got to fight ANOTHER battle with Wells Fargo Auto Lease Finance-totally different story there but I won it, with no help  from the Chapman fu**tards. This dealership did nothing to guide me through turning in my leased vehicle either- I  think they should have recommended me do some stuff as I was buying another  vehicle from them. Nope. You need to do your research on turning in a leased vehicle and don't expect anyone at the dealership to save you any money or give you any useful advice. You need to ask the bank that you're leasing from, where their lot is and turn the vehicle in there. If you leave it at Chapman or another dealership, you will be charged a pick up fee. I ended up beating this and not paying but don't rely on the dealership to make this an easy transition. I hope the knuckleheads that were here back in 2003 are gone. And by the way, my junk Dodge Stratus was totaled when I got hit by a drunk driver- the POS was an even bigger POS and insurance paid it off and paid my GAP insurance so I got rid of the car and wasn't stuck with it any longer. Words of advice: do not lease, do not purchase extended warranties, do not do business with Chapman, and buy from private sellers people- it is cheaper and they are more honest.

I do have a quick little theory though about the fact that this place wasn't as good as the other Poke I've been too here in Vegas, well the thing is, we came in here about 10 minutes before this place was about to close. But if you own a poke spot you're expected to have fresh fish all the way up to when you close, so I can't really use that too much of an excuse. Just like I said this place is great though, people that run this tiny poke spot are really really courteous, nice, and everything else that goes along those lines of words.\\n\\nWe ordered the usual stuff just more of it because we just came here right before we left back home to the bay.

{"trgt": "Just bought a home and decided to use Wave House based on the yelp reviews. I didn't scrutinize the job right away as I had many other companies coming out for bids on work that needed to be done to the home so I was pretty tied up to really inspect it. But it appeared to be clean.\\n\\nLater that evening i saw the stove and showers were not cleaned very well at all. There was alot of soap and hard water residue left behind, I could run my hand over the tiles and my hand was very chalky. The stove was still pretty crusty also. \\nThe office mgr., Melissa (I beleive) followed up the next day on the cleaning, I explained my disappointment and she immediately offered for the girls to come back and rectify it. I initially declined, and then later decided to have them come back. \\n\\nThey came out the next day and re-cleaned the stove and only 1 of the showers. I didn't say anything about the 2nd shower to them as I already felt very uncomfortable  about them coming back to re-clean, knowing that I complained about their cleaning.  (I really don't like addressing a job that is not well done with someone, they look at you cross, like how dare you complain about the job I performed) \\n\\nLater that night I started to unpack the boxes and get my house in order and that's when I really started noticing how dirty everything was still. I paid  for a deep move in clean. There was no furniture in the house so nothing in the way of them being able to clean all the nooks and crannies. I paid extra for all the windows, sliders and inside the cabinets and fridge to be cleaned.  They missed several cabinets shelves all together, that were very very dusty and cleaned the others poorly. There was still dirt & crumbs in several of the drawers, and dirt in corners of the cabinets. \\n\\nThe slider and window tracts were supposed to be cleaned as part of the window cleaning that I paid extra for, they were not cleaned very well, there was still dirt & grime in them. There was debris/particles all along the baseboards, in every room, that were not vacuumed. Dirt left in corners of the tile floors. They did a surface clean, but not a very thorough deep clean, which is what I paid for. I wanted it sparkling and sanitized, and it is not even close.\\n\\nMelissa did call after they came back out to follow up and I just let it go to voicemail and didn't call back to say anything about what I was seeing. I know they can't fix it if i don't say something, but I didn't want them to send out the same girls again and I have to point out all the areas they didn't clean properly, it is extremely unnerving to have to do that. \\n\\nI would give them 1 star based on their cleaning abilities. The only reason I gave them 2 stars was because of Melissa's customer service skills. I would never use them again and feel it was a complete waste of $220.\\n\\nI would recommend that if there are issues with a cleaning that you send out someone else so the customer is not dealing with \\\"glares\\\".\\n\\n\\n**Owner contacted me after seeing the review, he offered me a few different options to rectify the situation. I have decided to change my review to 4 stars from 2, due to the customer service I received in response to the situation.

I always liked the Rutland, but it felt very much like a bar to have meetings in, or a subdued drink. \\n\\nThe Huxley has a great vibe midweek. I've yet to visit at the weekend. But yknow what? As far as a bar for a mid-week after-work drink and munchies goes, it's pretty good. I've heard amazing things about their burgers and hot dogs. I will be back to try these (the burgers come with two patties per bun?!)\\n\\nWhen I came, I tried a Grapefruit Mojito and it was really fresh and delicious. When a bar isn't specifically a 'cocktail bar' I can be very suspicious. So many times a cocktail can come unmuddled, or with chunky ice instead of crushed, and it can just taste like watery, alcohol with a sprinkling of fruit. Not at The Huxley. I happened to meet the mixologist at the bar, who was very proud of all his creations (he has made all the recipes) and was really keen to make some cocktails for me. I love this kind of energy and passion. There were some delicious looking numbers there too.\\n\\nThe food menu is also really unusual, inspired and different. Hot dogs are, well, so hot right now. But there were also nibbles like Poached Duck Egg with black pudding and chorizo. Or a Scotch Dug Egg with HP sauce. Or Mini Chipolatas with dip, which I had. And the Battered Sole, with a side of seaweed salad.\\n\\nNote: do not put half the seaweed salad in your mouth at once. It tastes like the sea. Like the sea and fish. I used to have a through-and-through phobia of fish. It was not pleasant. I am assured, however, that a little nibble of the seafood salad is quite pleasant.\\n\\nThe Huxley is a new bar, and new bars take a while to settle into themselves. I hope it goes from strength to strength, however, as you can see they've put a lot of thought into the new food menu, the cocktail menu, and the new decor.\\n\\nNow, when can I go back for a burger?", "beginning": "I really like what The Huxley have done to this"}

{"trgt": "I decided to try this place out because of the good reviews people have given this place on Yelp.  People talked about how great the food was and how fair the price was for all-you-can-eat sushi; however, my experience with this place was thoroughly disappointing.  I gave this place a 2nd star as a benefit of the doubt.. perhaps I just happened to have picked a bad day to eat at this place.\\n\\nFirst, the service was HORRIBLE.  We asked for a table for 3, and instead of simply pulling an extra chair up two a 2-seated table, the waitress sat us at a table for 6, only to have a party of 8 walk in the door a minute after I had started on my soup, so she asked us to move to a different table so they could have our table.  This wouldn't have been so bad if it was the only problem we ran into for the night.\\n\\nNext, because the staff was in such a rush to move us, they took my salad away before I was actually finished with it.  Not a great way to start my all-you-can-eat experience.\\n\\nThird, when we put in our sushi order, the waitress had to clarify whether we were ordering nigiri per order (2 pieces) or per piece.  We specified that we wanted 2 pieces for every number we indicated on the sushi sheet.  She nodded and brought our order to the chef.  The first half of our order came out fine. We got the number of pieces we asked for, but when the 2nd half of our order came out, the sushi chef decided to interpret our orders as \\\"per piece\\\" so we only received one piece of every sushi ordered on the bottom half of the order sheet.  I guess it's no big deal, since we could always order more, but it took us a good 45 minutes just to get all of this order, we didn't know how much longer we'd have to wait to order everything again.  \\n\\nThe staff was also bad with keeping up with who they had already served soup & salad to and who they have not served yet (I happened to receive mine, but the person who showed up later in our group got nothing), and they were slow at refilling drinks too.  It might be because they got busy after the 1st hour we were there, but we wouldn't have dined for 2.5 hours if their service wasn't as slow.  \\n\\nAlso, the three sushi chefs who were working all disappeared at the same time, and were gone for about 5 minutes.  What kind of restaurant leaves the sushi bar completely unattended during the peak dinner hour?!?!?!\\n\\nAside from the service, the food selection was not great as it did not really include any appetizers, had limited all-you-can-eat sushi selection, and did not include any dessert.  We could've driven another 2 minutes down the block to another sushi restaurant that could've provided all the above mentioned items with same quality or even better quality fish than Sushi Kee for the same all-you-can-eat price of $20 per person.  \\n\\nAs for food quality, it was pretty decent.  It is among some of the freshest quality fish I've had in sushi restaurants, but there are definitely plenty of other places that could provide better quality fish as well.  The quality of Sushi Kee's fish is not enough to bring be back here again.\\n\\nIn summary, I would not go back to eat here knowing that Mido Sushi's only a block away.  I also would not recommend any of my friends to eat here either.  While the food quality was ok, the service and poor food selection definitely ruined the experience for me.  Had the service been better, I wouldn't mind recommending people to this place, but in all honesty, Mido Sushi truly can provide more options, better quality fish, and better service for the same exact price, so why waste time in trying this place out?", "beginning": "I decided to try this place out because of the"}

A pairing I would highly suggest trying.  Great combo and cap to a meal that was supposed to be just an app and some wine.\\n\\nSpeaking of wine, they have Chateaneuf-du-pape by the glass which is very rare and quite a treat.  They also offer a 3oz pour which is great if you enjoy a shallow glass for swiriling as I do.  It also gives you the ability to have a variety of wines throughout the evening if there wasn't a bottle in their wine shop selection that tickled your fancy.\\n\\nThe only bad part of the experience was hearing a guest be unnecessarily rude to the manager for no reason when the manager was clearly trying to accommodate him as best she could.  He likely didn't enjoy his experience as much as I did, because he was too busy being a d*ck.\\n\\nAll in all, a phenomenal place.

{"trgt": "The folks behind lbs, Holstein's and a few other of my top burger spots in town just opened up The Barrymore at the little-known Royal Resort just off the Strip, and I was more than excited to see what else they had in store for me. I've read a few things about the place since it opened, plus the pictures of the interior looked like my kind of spot so I really had some high hopes that I would be walking into my next go-to restaurant. All of these things surely added up to a great burger right? Not so much.\\n\\nThe restaurant itself has a great interior; contemporary, hip, kind of reminds me of the Vintner Grill but maybe a little fancier. There is a really small bar at the front, and I think two different dining rooms, seating a total of only 50 people I think so reservations are probably recommended. The Royal Resort is pretty cool as well, the lobby could still use a bit of work with their ceiling tiles for example, but I'm sure the average person won't notice this.\\n\\nThe menu looks great, I would definitely go back to try many of the items that sounded delicious, but as usual I'm there for only one thing. I did manage to sneak in the lobster mac & cheese before the burger came out; it was decent but not amazing for $13. I've also heard from many people that they have a fantastic cocktail menu which I wasn't totally in the mood for on this visit but would definitely be willing to go back for.\\n\\nThe Steakhouse Burger on the menu is listed as grass-fed beef patty, bacon marmalade, gruyere cheese, frisee, oven-roasted tomatoes and garlic aioli. That's quite a lot of flavors packed into one assembly, and I was almost nervous as to whether all of those would be able to stand out or if some would overpower the others. The burger came out with a very strange looking bun, and pinned with a wooden steak with the lbs logo on it which I thought was odd, but made me even more excited because I haven't had a bad burger there yet. Maybe it's because we weren't actually at lbs but this wasn't up to par. The meat had good flavor, was definitely cooked medium-rare as ordered, but the toppings and bun added up to something just short of working for me. As predicted, I think the toppings all kind of got lost together, although if you isolated and pulled out individual bites of each they were quite good. The bacon marmalade was probably my favorite, and the bun really detracted from everything for me. The bun to meat ratio was ok, but the bun itself was very dry and just really odd. Overall it was ok, but not at all what I was hoping for.\\n\\nThe fries were good; they had a bit of seasoning and good flavor, and luckily were included with the price of the burger otherwise I'd say the $6 for a side order of them is a bit much. My friend ordered asparagus instead of the fries and we were sadly charged an additional $7. I understand that some menu changes come with an additional fee, but I wasn't too crazy about that line item on our bill even given the 'fanciness' of the restaurant. If we hadn't done any strange swaps, our meal would have come to $27 for the two burgers which isn't horrible given the location just off the Strip as well as the interior of the restaurant, unfortunately I thought the burger was just ok. My friend liked hers, but I thought it could be better. If you want to spend about the same on a really great burger I'd say go to Holstein's if you're on the strip or lbs if you're out in the suburbs. But if you want to check out a really cool looking restaurant and eat some other great food definitely check this place out.", "beginning": "The folks behind lbs, Holstein's and a few other of"}

Entering the prep room, the nurse inserting the IV poked and missed so many times my vein collapsed and my hand swelled up like a football and they had to move to the other hand, all the while, all she could talk about was the tatto on my wrist, which is a memorial to my son who had recently passed. This, of course, upsetting, depressing, and irritating me right before surgery. Again, really??  Upon waking in recovery, I had major spinal surgery. My entire lower lumbars were fused with an unbelievable amount of hardware. My surgeon, who is not a resident doctor there, was wonderful. Sorry to say, this hospital was too far under his league of expertise. I woke from surgery to an 10 inch incision in my abdominal area and an 8 inch incision in my back, 42 staples, and an indescribable level of pain. I was given no pain control whatsoever. I laid in recovery like this for 9 hours before I was given a room. In the meantime, my husband and other son were waiting in the waiting room for 15 hours at this point, not being told anything about my condition, and when asked, they were told I just went home by a nurse who was impatient and uncaring and didn't bother to check for them. They had to ask another nurse, who finally found out that I finally got into a room, and was told a room number and I was there. They got to the room to find I was not only not there, but it wasn't even my room. When they finally got the right room, they sat and waited there because I wasn't even out of recovery yet. Incompetent.  Once in my room, the nurses were huffy, uncaring, impatient and rude. I was left with no pain control for 24 hours before my surgeons assistant came and took care of it herself. Every time I needed assistance, I had to call for a nurse repeatedly, only to get results when I became loud out of pain and frustration. Every person there during my visit was incompetent, rude, obviously hated their jobs, uncaring, in compassionate, and god forbid if it was time for a shift change.

{"trgt": "With the energy-charged locomotive of urban rejuvenation happening in Downtown Vegas, it's with much excitement that we ventured our way to it's newest arrival, Eat.\\n\\nFrom what I gathered, Eat is a casual venue, similar to a diner, but with a hipper atmosphere and a focus on quality-driven, locally sourced comfort food.  We have been waiting for this kind of establishment for a long time; Vegas definitely needs an urban identity with a sense of community away from commercial strip centers and suburban hubs.  Downtown is growing into it's own, shedding it's identity crisis of yesteryear.\\n\\nAs the surroundings are still a bit shaky, the actual building was in good solid condition and the parking around the corner gave a sense of safety and comfort (still faintly reminiscent of 'The Walking Dead' with Zombies eerily meandering the streets)....\\n\\nAnd as soon as you walk in, you feel a new presence has just emerged, a real sense of place.  We immediately fell in love-the interior is cool but not over-designed, an instantly inviting atmosphere that make you want to stay and enjoy what the kitchen has to offer. I had a terribly good feeling about Eat; and in my mind I was already coming back to eat...\\n\\nWe're gushing over the design and atmosphere, but in all truth; Vegas restaurants outside of the Strip have much to be desired in terms of decor.  Many have great food, but are so lacking in interiors that are actually humane, (not some graphic design nightmare or some catalogue cookie cutter interior), some don't even bother with any decorations-it's bereft of joy...\\n\\nWe were so excited that we decided to sit at the communal table (totally our last choice for seats in normal circumstances, but it was centrally located and we could see the entire room from that table). Loving every moment and excited for our Brunch!\\n\\nAnd we were in front of the open kitchen, so we could see all the action! Being that we came on a weekend, Eat was serving the Brunch menu which is our favorite meal of the day!  I was so excited, since I though we had missed breakfast and they had the most interesting items in the morning!\\n\\nWell, it was at the top of the menu and we couldn't resist ordering the Beignets dusted in Powder Sugar with a side of Jam and Vanilla Marscapone. It was a really great way to start off the meal and it was perfect with the Coffee!  BTW the table is set with Mugs and condiments in the center of the Communal table and Counter which is a great feature - kudos!\\n\\nI came in thinking I was gonna order one thing, but I ended up really cheating on my cheat day; The Chicken Fried Steak smothered in Country Gravy + Two Eggs Over Easy + Smashed Potatoes + possibly the best Rye Toast I've ever had!!\\n\\nI relished this dish, the chicken fried steak had the best crunchy texture that contrasted effortlessly  with the creamy/chunky gravy that was....really to die for.  It was a comforting country breakfast that I knew would last me all throughout the day and well into the evening.  The Eggs were cooked perfectly, Ioved scooping up the yolk with the thick cut pieces of Rye toast and the Potatoes sent me into overdrive...\\n\\nBy our waiter's suggestion, Rick order the Huevos Motulenos: Two Eggs Over Easy + Red and Green Chili Sauce + Black Beans + Green Peas + Feta Cheese +Sauteed Banana all on a Corn Tortilla.  WOW...the flavors bursted with vibrance, but the real game changer was the Sauteed Banana-it elevated this dish!! I had no idea that this one ingredient could really create a whole different flavor profile that made me fall head over heels in love! The sweetness toned the hot spicy Chiles and added a gentler texture.\\n\\nWe also ordered a side of the Chicken Apple Sausage which was extremely juicy and satisfying!  There wasn't one thing that we ordered that we wouldn't get again in a heartbeat-everything was amazing....\\n\\nAnd as any proud owner would, Chef Natalie came to each table and asked how the meal was, and we couldn't have been more happier with the food, the service and the ambience!  Eat is surely a destination restaurant and a definite must for anyone who has a love for comfort food and desire to patronize local businesses that work so hard to delivery great experiences!  We are devoted fans and will soon become regulars at Eat!!\\n\\n\\nRatings (Out of FiveStars)\\nFood:           5\\nService:       5\\nAmbience:   5\\n\\nPERFECT SCORE!!!", "beginning": "With the energy-charged locomotive of urban rejuvenation happening in Downtown"}

We rented two rooms and to begin with the carpets were filthy in the room and hallways, one room the sofa a ripped lining which hung on the floor. The alarm clock made this really weird humming noise and I had to unplug the makeup mirror was broken and had no light as well as the base was broken so it listed to one side. When you flushed the toilet the outside sink gurgled for a few minutes. I asked for two non-smoking rooms and one stunk of cigarette smoke.\\n\\nI stayed at the Rio for three days and one of my rooms was not cleaned for two consecutive days. When I called housekeeping they tried to say that we were in the room too long in the morning but we were up and out by 11AM each day.

Once I returned home I completed a survey sent to me by the Rio and I heard nothing but once I posted a review such as this one on Trip Advisor I was contacted by the Total Rewards depart offering me an upgraded room the next time I visited. \\n\\nThis tells me that they in fact had cleaner and better maintained rooms if you pay extra, otherwise you get filth, no housekeeping services and tattered furniture.

{"trgt": "My parents love pho so I've practically been enjoying Vietnamese cuisine since the womb. Ha! No wonder I love it so much myself that it was always on the weekly dinner rotation when I lived in OC. Alas, I moved to North Phoenix and I dont have little pho shops or boba cafes on every street corner. I've learned that I have to drive a ways to Chandler/Mesa to satisfy these cravings. Imagine my surprise when the husband and I noticed Tea Lite Cafe when we changed up our movie theater location this past weekend. Of course, we had to try it out and we'd been dying for some pho for months now.\\n\\nWe both ordered the beef pho and took a seat. The place is small but there's plenty of seating and still feels spacious. The cashier up front was super friendly and welcoming which was nice. We didn't have to wait too long for our food to arrive...another plus. \\n\\nThe pho itself has really tasty broth and the beef was nice and tender. I was disappointed by the small portion of bean sprouts, mint leaves and limes that accompanied the soup. I'm used to overflowing plates of these veggies so I can load up my soup to my heart's desire. In fact, my hubby usually counts on me doing this since I end up eating all my veggies and leaving most of the beef for him. Double ha! But the lack of sprouts and mint leaves didn't put a damper on the great taste of the pho. What I did miss was the traditional pho ingredients like tripe, rare steak and tendons. I know, I know...sounds intense but trust me it makes pho taste soooo good. I guess I just have a usual when it comes to pho so I was a little disappointed when I couldn't satisfy my craving to the utmost degree. Woe is me. \\n\\nBut let me conclude by stating again that the pho here is really good and has a great flavor to the broth. I think the hubby and I will go back since it is so conveniently located to us. It'll definitely do in a pinch although I am sure I will occasionally find myself making the trek to get me some tripe!", "beginning": "My parents love pho so I've practically been enjoying Vietnamese"}

The waitress was a young girl with very little social skills and really needed help with articulation and volume. She had trouble multitasking and lacked attentiveness. But the other servers picked up the slack. So all was good. We ordered gyro, fatoosh and cilantro hummus. Cilantro hummus is always consistent and good. The gyro not so much. The meat was cooked like bacon: crisp, crumbly and almost considered burnt. It had to be sent back. The return food was decent but had some mystery meat wrapped inside that we will assume for our piece of mind was grill bits.  The fatoosh is 3/4 rice, which is awesome if you love rice, not awesome if you are looking for a light flavorful salad that is typical with fatoosh. The kicker, the manager and other servers wiped up tables that were considerably messy that had children seated at them with DRY napkins. No bleach/ disinfectant / wet towels used. And promptly sat another families with children at those tables. Poor quality food, subpar service I can tolerate. Not uncleanliness and poor hygiene.

In my 20s i would have been into the huge party scene at the pool but being a fresh 40 year old, I am over that stuff. I liked a quiet pool with less people. The Hard Rock is complete opposite - people throwing balls back and forth, everyone is wasted or on their way to that point, music is blaring louder than a night club, and girls grinding on each other to impress tatted out muscle dudes they never met. We spent about 90 minutes poolside each day b/c we went for GNR not for hanging at the pool. \\n\\nMr. Lucky's is the 24 hour restaurant and it's where I had the WORST meal I ever ate. The eggs were chewy and inedible and they even messed up the English muffin. Seriously how do you do that? Plus it was pricey for shitty food. I was most upset that I wasted valuable stomach space but I didn't eat much. I spent $20 for breakfast and was only able to stomach an eighth of it. Wasteful but it was truly one of the worst meals I ever had. Do yourself a favor and do not even bother eating there.\\n\\nFu - we had dinner here one night and none of us was impressed. I guess I had high expectations and was very excited for \\\"Chinese\\\" food but it wasn't good. Out of 4 of us, 1 person liked their meal. The staff was friendly though and the meal wasn't horrible it just wasn't what we were hoping for. \\n\\nCulinary Dropout: This is the BEST restaurant at the Hard Rock. They have the best staff - so much fun. We loved our servers and went here 3 times in 2 days! Their happy hour is really good, they make amazing drinks - Bourbon Mules, a Dark and Stormy, or if you fancy tequila they have a great selection of spirits. And all their juices are freshly muddled. Their food is awesome too. For snacks, they make their own potato chips with an onion dip but my favorite thing on their menu are the hot pretzel bites served with a fondue dipping sauce. RIDICULOUS!!!! I ate those 2 nights in a row and could polish off an order all by myself. For happy hour they are half price too!!!  They also have a kick ass kale and corn salad and to-die-for SWEET POTATO CANNELLONI. The pasta is so thin so you can taste the filling which is a beautiful mixture of smoked shallots, mushrooms, snap peas, and parmesan. \\n\\nThe Joint: I love this venue b/c it's small and the set up is cool b/c everyone has a good seat plus is you want to go to the bar you can still see the stage. Overall, we had a good experience but I would only stay here again if I was going to a show at the Joint b/c it's too far from the strip which limits my feeding choices :O)", "beginning": "At first I was so turned off by this place"}

I admire the decor, it looks really hip and fresh, but food wise, this place is way too expensive, and honestly, poor quality. \\n\\nFAME seems like it's set up to be like a modern Asian Market Place with vendors lined up kind of like a lunch line. There was Fuku Burger at one end of the area, which my friends ended up eating at and said it was pricier than the food truck. I chose to go to the opposite side of the area, where they showcased duck and pork hanging (kind of like Sam Woo BBQ, if anyone is familiar with that restaurant). I ordered the duck and pork combo and switched the rice out for noodles (lo-mein possibly), which came out to $18. While I definitely thought this was way over-priced for something trying to mimic an Asian Market (where prices are cheap as hell, helloooo i.e. Philippines, Thailand, etc), I still gave it a fair shot.  \\n\\nStill, the quality of food was garbage. I literally saw them microwave the duck. They didn't cut it from the duck hanging in the window, and when the server brought the food to my table, she forgot my utensils and said, \\\"Oh shoot, I forgot to give you utensils, can you just get them?\\\" Smh. Also, the manager scolded one of his workers in front of me for not giving someone a number card, really not professional. \\n\\nThe food tasted old, not fresh, and the duck was soggy. The pork was reasonable, but definitely not $18 worth. The noodles were so-so, oily, and not very flavorful, and the side vegetables were oily and also not fresh. \\n\\nIf this place wants to survive, they need to cut prices, work on quality of food, big time, and work on customer service.

Our waiter failed to mention that the vegetarian dishes listed w/the tasting menu can be ordered a la carte until we asked whether they have side dishes.  When I pointed to the warm corn terrine, he instead brought the foie gras.  Big difference.  When we alerted the staff, they just said, 'well, i can take it back or you can eat it.'  Which the rest of the party did. And was charged. The corn terrine never appeared.  Did I mention that I told him specifically that I'm pregnant and couldn't have certain foods (to my sadness), such as foie gras, soft cheeses, rare meat. A full conversation.  But apparently, he isn't paid to listen.  Because   my medium filet (again, no rare meat) was presented still mooing. After it was sent back, it came back still kicking around.  AT that point, I just ate the end piece and was done with it.  Look, if that particular kitchen usually goes the rarer side, you need to tell the diner, and she/he will order appropriately.  Onto dessert; what a dissapointment.  Half the dessert menu requires that you order it 25 minutes prior.  This included the souffle.  Which was gelatinous.  The entire table had a taste and wouldn't eat the remaining.  \\n\\nI eat out.  A lot.

However - this is the restaurant my son picked so we went.\\n\\nThere are really no complaints about the food really - it was neither Ohmygoodness awesome or Boythatreallysucks nastiness.  Food was warm and tasted good - just not memorable to me.\\n\\nSons got a rack of babybacks, tri tip and brisket - they all enjoyed them.  Since I am going to have backyard bbq deliciousness tonight - Hubby and I both went for the NY Strip - they were delicious - just not mind blowing to me.  Our dinners came with corn on the cob - didn't enjoy the bruised parts all over it though.\\n\\nWhat annoyed me though is a couple of things that had nothing to do about the food (Maybe I was just in a bad mood)...\\n\\n1.) We made reservations and our party of six arrived about 15 minutes early - there were plenty of places for our party to sit and there was no other parties waiting - so why did we have to wait?  Once they finally got around to seating us they stuck us clear in the back - I just don't like the layout of the restaurant very much - the back rooms feel closed off from the rest of the restaurant and the small room we were in felt somewhat claustrophic and our party of six was crammed in like sardines - even though there were other places to put us.  I hate being squished!\\n\\n2.) We were seated right next to the table that had our server's sister and boyfriend.  Guess who got the amazing service we should have had.  Our service wasn't horrible - I just felt like an afterthought.  She wasn't rude - just was more interested in talking to her sister and her date instead of checking in our her other tables.  Like I said she wasn't rude - just did the bare minimum of service - we saw her when she took our drink order, when she served drinks then immediately took meal order, the delivery of our food and when it was time for the check.  She did ask once during the meal how everything was.  The rest of the time it seemed like she chatted with her sister and her date. \\n\\n3.)   Like I said - maybe I was just in a bad mood - but why oh why every time we have gone here - we get seated near the large parties with annoying little kids - I have been there, done that.  I never let my kids screech to their hearts content when they were little - and the five year old - running around their table and screaming - Grrrrr!   \\n\\nI am really not in the mood to go back anytime soon.", "beginning": "It's been a few years since we ate here last."}

{"trgt": "\\\"If you build it, they will come\\\" - but maybe not to Chase Field, well... unless the team is winning of course. But even then, they will only come depending on the food options and free promotions available to them on that particular day. \\n \\nAlright Diamondbacks Nation... well maybe not nation, maybe Diamondbacks fans? Nope, there aren't enough of you for that title either. What about supporters? Maybe groupies? Well whatever you're called, where are you? You've got one gorgeous baseball field and a World Series title, yet this stadium sits lifelessly in the Arizona desert.\\n \\nIt's sad actually. Chase Field is gorgeous, and dare I say... breathtaking. Stretching far and wide across the Phoenix skyline, Chase Field stands tall among the buildings that call downtown Phoenix home. This technological work of art brought baseball to the desert, and that's quite a feat. Even some of baseballs greatest players, like The Big Unit for example, have called it home. Sparkling clean and strategically situated for easy access and parking, Chase Field calls out to \\\"D-Backs fans\\\" - begging them to venture though its towering gated entrance to seek sanctuary within its cool climate controlled atmosphere. All of the vendors, ushers and ballpark staff at this stadium are also welcoming, helpful and friendly. There isn't a bad seat at Chase Field. The view is virtually perfect from every angle. Yet the seats remain fan-less. \\n \\nI do understand part of the reason why fans don't flock to Chase Field. An empty stadium is a common transplant state/expansion team symptom, like the desolate Tropicana Field for example. Most people in Arizona probably aren't even \\\"D-Backs fans\\\". I get that. I'm not one. But even I pay more attention to the action at Chase Field and have more admiration of its beauty than a majority of those \\\"D-Backs fans.\\\" \\n\\nIt is as if \\\"D-Backs fans\\\" are confused, and they think Chase Field is an indoor shopping mall - because in between the shopping, the food, the activities, the awful emcee that talks in between innings, the dancing and the trivia games, none of the \\\"D-Backs fans\\\" seem to have time to watch baseball.  \\n\\nSo \\\"D-Backs fans\\\" - you need to up your appreciation level for the game. It's the roar of the crowd that brings a stadium to life. Team pride is what makes or breaks a ballpark's atmosphere. And when you are talking on your phone through an entire at bat, standing up right in the middle of a crucial pitch to get more ballpark chow or allowing your children to turn empty seats into their own personal jungle gym or hide and go seek game, why even come to the stadium? Go to the mall or visit a park for that matter. Regardless of whether you're in first place or last place, this is your team in your city. It's not enjoyable to see such beauty go to waste. So stop swimming in your indoor ballpark pool (I still can't believe how tacky that pool looks in the outfield), worry about what ice cream extravaganza you are going to stuff your face with later, and let's watch some baseball! \\n \\nIt's called game time \\\"D-Backs fans\\\", not play time.", "beginning": "\\\"If you build it, they will come\\\" - but maybe"}

A burger is a burger right? Well no not really. And BurGR proves that you can still make a piece of meat between two pieces of bread pretty unique. \\n\\nHubby and I tried the place out on a Thursday night about 6pm. We stayed at planet hollywood and every time we go by BurGR There always seems to be a line. But we were told 25 min and it really took us maybe 15 min in line. You can get in faster if you opt for one of the high top tables which are teeny but it'll do. Good view of the TV to catch some of the games.  I got the chanterelle burger which doesn't come with cheese but you can add on. I opted for Fontina cheese which worked great with the arugula, mushrooms and fig jam. My hubby got the farm burger with the fried egg and duck bacon. Wow. I mean. There are no words for that burger. Except maybe crazy delicious. What I like about the burgers are that they're not huge and unmanageable to eat. They fit nicely in the hands and are the perfect portion at least for us. \\n\\nThe truffle Parmesan fries. Very good. Not too truffle-y. We also had the jalepeno poppers which were delicious!! The floor mgr came to check on us and gave us a funny tidbit, that in each batch of poppers there's one where they leave the seeds. apparently  my hubby got that one bc he bit into it and felt like his face was on fire. But the poppers. I highly recommend them. They have bacon inside them, hello!!\\n\\nTo finish off our dinner we got the sticky toffee push pops which were delicious and just the right touch of sweetness to end your meal.

{"trgt": "I've lived here for about a year now so I figure it's safe that I've experienced everything I need to for making a review. I'll make this simple via pros/cons. \\n\\nPros:  I like the style of the building and it's proximity to downtown and the freeways. Pretty easy to get to many different spots from this location via I-15/95 to 215. The staff that work in security, valet, HOA, and maintenance are all quite friendly. Parking for guests is valet only which is nice so they don't have to park on the side/back which is a pretty shady area. Another reviewer posted about valet blocking the inbound parking entrance, that has been recently changed and the valet is now due West at the entrance loop thus no longer blocking the inbound lane. The building is VERY secure. Current regulations do not allow guests in the building and up the elevators without being escorted by a resident. Cameras at all entrances, in all elevators; have not noticed any in the garage. Key fobs to get in from garage, from lobby to elevators and inside elevator to your floor. This place has become locked down like no other place in town.  The gym is a very nice and clean facility. The pool, while nice and generally clean, is a bit stark in its design and landscape/hardscape design. The lobby and common areas are kept quite clean; likely varies by floor and if you happen to live with slobs on your floor...mine is pretty good in this regard. I've only used the concierge for dry cleaning and that is a nice feature to have. Choose Tiffany cleaners, not the other company they are setup with. \\n\\nCons: The majority of the units only have one assigned parking spot deeded with the unit and the spots are about 20% more narrow than they should be...cramped and door dings possible. The recent security lock down due to hookers, pimps, drug dealers inhabiting the place creates a big inconvenience for us normal folk. Guest drives up, security calls you, you grant access to valet, guest walks to security desk in lobby and you must come down to the lobby to escort them up to your unit; pain in the ass. I get the reasoning behind this rule and hope if/when the thugs and losers are kicked out we can go back to the proper system of security sending the guest directly to your floor electronically as it should be. The area around the building...shady and crime ridden. Do not walk north of the property alone or at night is all I can say. Laundry in the units is a horrible one piece stacked unit...it's loud and will ruin your laundry quickly. Water pressure delivered to the unit is horrible. I've had people out three times to resolve, still horrible. I feel sorry for those that have long hair as you will not properly rinse out the shampoo with this low of a pressure. Should you wish to take a bath...plan ahead!  It takes 24.5 minutes to fill my tub; yes I timed it. The tub/shower combo is a poor design...the outter edge is round; it's hard to explain but good luck keeping water INSIDE the shower when you use it, your floor will be wet and you've been warned :-)\\n\\nOverall I'd give this place a 2.5-2.75 if I could but felt somewhat generous due to the cleanliness and friendly staff. Not sure how long I'll stay...grass is always greener you know?  Price per square foot is high if you compare to a normal apartment or house but is lower than the overall Vegas price per square foot for hi-rises.", "beginning": "I've lived here for about a year now so I"}

Let's start from the top and work through the experience. \\n\\nParking: Ample for lunch, but for a 600 seat restaurant it would be a little tight during prime time hours. \\n\\nDecor. Their website claims an Art Deco appearance, but having spent a lot of time brushing up on Kansas City's Art Deco architecture which led me into a more expansive study or two, I'm not an \\\"expert\\\" on Art Deco style but I'm not an amateur either. Count me among the people who are not impressed with this location's styling. It was ho-hum, and quite frankly I've seen and experienced better. \\n\\nService: Slow and not impressive. I ordered the Tuesday lunch special. I never received my chili that I ordered that was part of the special. Another person at our table ordered extra food at the end of our meal to take back to the office and it took an awful long time for it to arrive. Also I was not offered a refill on my iced tea either. That's something I shouldn't have to ask for, it simply needs to be taken care of, especially at a restaurant of this caliber. \\n\\nFood: I liked the 4 bread choices. But quite frankly I was not impressed with their sides which lacked adequate seasonings and spices. And then there's the problem with the meat and where a Cardinal Sin was committed. I watched as it was carved in front of me. The appearance was good, I brought it back to the table looking forward to enjoying it. 3 bites in and I'm like this is so disappointing. It wasn't tender, and it lacked good flavor. For a minute I was wondering if they had run out of quality meat and had substituted Sysco's cheapest product line instead. I needed to eat so I took a few more bites as to not offend the people I was with, but it was extremely disappointing. For a place with a name that says THE PRIME RIB on the sign, that has 70 some odd years of providing food service, I was disappointed at the quality of food that ended up on my plate. The horseradish was a pleasant surprise though and the saving grace that allowed me to consume the sandwich and not leave with a growling stomach. \\n\\nVerdict: Not impressed. At all. I'm thankful I didn't have to foot the bill for this experience, and I'm glad I got to experience a Vegas \\\"legend\\\" but Lawry's won't make my list of places I will have business lunches at, or take out of town guests to if I want to showcase the best of what Las Vegas has to offer. \\n\\n2 Stars.

I figured since it was pretty close to my hotel I'd give it a try for dinner one night.  I ordered a Veggie New Yorker.

The decor was beautiful and from the moment we walked in the service was superb. Looking at the menu I was excited to try a number of things. I settled on their house sangria, bbq chicken pizza and the blue cheese truffle chips. As soon as J heard that red snapper was the fish special of the day he knew he had to order it. We were both really impressed with the truffle chips, they melted in my mouth and I could have made an entire meal out of them. When we got our entrees I dug into the bbq chicken pizza which was good but nothing outstanding. J's excitement about the red snapper quickly faded when he realized it was completely raw on the inside. We notified the server and he quickly whisked it away to get a new piece of fish cooked. About 15 minutes later he came back with another piece of fish and had J cut into it while he was standing there and sure enough the fish was raw again. Another 15 minutes later he came back out and the fish was no longer raw (yay) but as J was eating it he didn't have much to say except for the fact that it was now so overcooked that it was dry and had lost most of the flavor. By this time it was late, he was hungry and didn't want to wait for yet another piece of fish so he still ate it. A few minutes after finishing our entrees we got a surprise from our server who brought us coffee and a phenomenal chocolate souffle on the house due to the errors with the fish.

However, we were quite a bit disappointed.\\n\\nThe restaurant itself was very nice and had a great ambiance.  I loved the decoration and the way the restaurant was laid out.  It had a very open floor plan but was very quiet.  The tables and chairs were awesome!  \\n\\nWe had the fall tasting menu for $75/person which consisted of the hanger steak, the wagyu steak, and the scallops.  The presentation of the dishes were in very nice looking skillets and the steaks and the scallops looked absolutely delicious.  However, when we started tasting it, I have to admit that the best dish was not the wagyu steak but the hanger steak.  The wagyu steak was cold and chewy.  I had expected a \\\"melt in your mouth\\\" sensation but didn't get any of that.\\n\\nAll the other dishes were great.  The appetizers were very good and the desserts were very good as well.  However, their signature steak dish really disappointed me.\\n\\nThe main reason I gave the restaurant 3 stars was really the service.  When we were first seated, we got great service.  Our water was never empty and our server was very attentive.  About 1 hour into our dinner, 2 large groups came and sat down in the tables next to ours.  From that point on, I could not get anybody's attention and had to consistently ask for water or service.  That was very disappointing for such a top rated restaurant.  Incidentally, I felt that I got better service at the Burger Bar at Mandalay bay.", "beginning": "My newly wedded wife and I were really looking forward"}

Which one is it?? \\n\\nI then get passed off to a membership manager. Same contradictory garbage.  Then she finishes with \\\"well what do you want me to do about it\\\".

I call the number and it is a non working phone number!!  So I called the gym back to let them know and they state it is the only number that they had.  They tell me I should go on the Golds Gym website to find the number. The only problem with that is that the gym is franchise owned, not corporate owned. So the only people who know what collection agency they use is the local gym.   After being placed on hold for several minutes, they are able to tell me the name of the collection agency they use and suggest I google it to find the number.  \\n\\nI'll be researching debt collection laws as I have a pretty good hunch they cant send you to collections without first contacting you.

Honestly, I thought the whole idea of floating in a saltwater bath was pretty hokey (this guy tends to be a little out there, if you're catching what I'm throwing) so I didn't expect to have a life-altering experience. Much to my surprise, I was completely amazed. After an orientation, completing a form (which included a notice of a $500 fee if you defecated in the water!) and watching a short video, I was off to my private room to shower and soak. The silent and dark, with the lid closed, option sounded like the best way to fully immerse myself into this experience. Here's what I discovered: We all float down here, including me; weightlessness feels great and relaxing; I carry a LOT of tension between my shoulder blades; this water burns your eyes; after 48 minutes in this environment, I become anxious; I'll be going back again.\\n\\nMy friend Keith said I'd probably sleep better than ever that night, which wasn't the case.

{"trgt": "My friend warned me about Spirit Airlines. It is a budget airline and if you want to travel a short distance at cheaper discounted prices, you can come here. I decided that the one time I would be on Spirit Airlines is for a quick flight from LAX to Vegas. It would only take 45 minutes and it will be worth the price. I can deal with the worn out seats, the cramped space, and the additional charges for luggage because I know that it is a discount airline. They will nickel and dime you ($100.00 +) for additional luggage carry on. It is pretty extreme, but I decided to brush it off.\\n\\nThe plane slowly started to take off and we started to see that there were already some problems: the plane was old and couldn't resist turbulence. For the first 15 minutes that the plane was in the air, the entire cabin was shaking around so much that the passengers started to hold on tightly to the walls of the plane. I felt nauseous by how much the plane was dropping up and down and twisting around. It didn't feel safe at all. \\n\\nThe second issue is that most of the flights are delayed. The planes arrive late frequently and it's hard to get to another connecting flight if it is an unreliable airline.\\n\\nThird issue is the customer service through the phone. I tried calling the 1-800 number for baggage service and information about the airline. There are only four options and you can not speak to a single operator. The phone line hangs up on you after 10 seconds if you don't respond. \\n\\nUnreliability is one thing. Just because you consider yourself a discount airline doesn't mean you should be making your flights not safe for your passengers. I'm sorry, but that is where I draw the line. No thanks, Spirit, not again. \\n\\nOn another note: Spirit Airlines will call themselves the fasted growing airline in the US.

We then moved from Crossfit to Athletic Conditioning (yay - two workouts in one!), which was also intense but a great workout. Nothing like warming up by pushing a 100 lb sled, right? I'll tell you one thing - I consider myself to be in decent shape - and this workout really kicked my butt (thanks, Yelp!). \\n\\nAs to the facility as a whole, it's absolutely gorgeous but definitely out of my price range.

{"trgt": "Ever since moving from Phoenix to Scottsdale, I haven't wanted to drive to downtown Phoenix since it's such a far drive, especially after work during rush hour. Unfortunately, that means I'm missing some of my favorite restaurants! With a specific craving in mind, I went on a search and found Tommy Bahamas. After looking at their menu and their Happy Hour, I told my husband we were going here after work last Friday. I'm glad we did, because we had a really great time!\\n\\nWe arrived about 5pm and it wasn't too packed. We had the option of sitting outside for Happy Hour, or going upstairs into the restaurants indoor bar. We chose outside since the misters were going and wanted to unwind after being inside all day. Our waiter was quick to arrive and take our drink orders. Both of us ordered the Crazy Cuban off the HH menu - a cocktail of rum, pineapple juice, and banana liquor. It was one of my cravings and it definitely hit the spot! Then we ordered the fish tacos and edamame hummus off the HH menu as well. My husband ordered the crab bisque off the dinner menu. The food arrived quickly and we dug in. The tacos were great. We both really enjoyed them and would order them again. The hummus was okay. It was cold and came with long rectangular crackers they called flat bread. To me, flat bread is like pita bread and they were crackers. There's a difference. My husband thought the hummus was good and he ate more of it than me. Still a little hungry, we decided to order the Cuban. Oh god, I am so glad we did. It had pulled pork, ham, gruyere cheese, pickles, and spicy mustard. This was a flavor combination of the gods. My husband and I really enjoyed this and it's our new favorite. It came with Yucca Fries, which we decided to try, but you could sub them for something else. (Yucca Fries are made from the root of the Yucca plant and are like deep fried potatoes - they weren't anything special in my opinion.) Finally, the dessert tray came circling around. They had so many delicious looking desserts to try. A chocolate cake, a butterscotch pudding, a pineapple cr\\u00e8me brulee, a pina colada cake, and a chocolate malt tart. We ordered the chocolate malt tart but it was a tough decision. (We'll have to come back to try some of the others.) The tart was delicious was very heavy. We took about 90% of it home to enjoy later. \\n\\nOverall, it was a great experience and we'll be back.

Okay, I rarely ever eat sushi at these buffets but since they had no shrimp or crab or mussels or any other seafood during lunch time despite a $20.95 price tag, but I was desperate for anything somewhat fishy. How do I describe the rice? Let me see...a cross between spoiled pudding, 5 day old rice, and concrete grounds. I actually just took the small pieces of fish and shrimp on this sad excuse of sushi rice, ate the fish and used the rice to build a pyramid on my plate. Yes, I've eaten at AYCE sushi buffets so I don't equate them to sushi restaurants, but my goodness this was horrid. Pork ribs? Well, they display real oak wood behind the serving counter at the bbq area, but it's not oak-fired ribs. It was artificial smoke flavor...and it was putrid. Holy cow...it didn't last .5 of a millisecond in my mouth. It was that bad. How in the world can a piece of spare rib be that bad? It tasted like gasoline...and it may have been. You get the idea. Food was old (like left over from the previous day or something, not fresh). Here's the kicker: despite 2 for 1 coupons and/or 2 free buffets, the breakfast and lunch lines were very minimal. The hotel guests probably read the reviews about this buffet and stayed away. Me? I thought maybe I could save $50 by going to this buffet with the 2 free coupons and invest it elsewhere. Bad decision. The insult is they actually charge $20.95 for this buffet to those who don't have coupons. They should PAY people $20.95 for coming to eat there. I should thank my stars that I at least got fed for free BUT when you're on vacation in Vegas and you have to make meals count cuz there are only 3 meals a day you should at least enjoy your meal. This buffet was horrible, putrid, old, stanky, and absolutely insulting. A Vegas buffet shouldn't be this bad. The downtown Vegas buffets were even better than this for 1/3 the cost.

The music is authentic, the production is delicate, and the theme is a triumph. This is a must-see from Cirque du Soleil when you hit Vegas. \\n\\nThe music is impeccable; every single sound comes from MJ and his work. Imagine MJ's original voice recording on IMAX quality output. It feels as if you were listening to him live. \\n\\nThe theme is a triumph: extolling the king, embodiment of the immortal. This is shown by the arrangement: no one can singly represent the King. It is the culmination of the entire cast and audience that renders MJ's presence.  We are the same, we are ONE. \\n\\nThe symbolism of MJ's glove, hat, and socks is empowering, because the objects represent the legacy that is visible to the eyes and tangible to the touch. I really love it.  \\n\\nYou will notice the original dance moves are shown last in the choreography of each song. Instead of presenting a blatant imitation, the choreography gracefully conveys the message, \\\"We want to dance like the King.\\\" Creativity and freshness dance on stage. \\n\\nInterestingly, there is also the element of rebuttal against the media. On the injustice of social media, I cannot empathize more with MJ. I was glad the show touches on that aspect of MJ's life. \\n\\nAll I am trying to say is, if you love MJ, you will enjoy the show. \\n\\nOn the down side, I was only half-impressed by the acrobatics. Some acts hit the plateau rather quickly as the movements become repetitive. Some lack the grace and difficulty. On a few occasions, you could tell the performers were trying too hard to match the beats. Some performances, such as stick fighting, are extraneous, while the over-presence of the popper and guitar player suggests a limited cast. In a nutshell, this is not fully a circus show, a concert, or a dance show. This is MJ. \\n\\nYou are paying for the beautiful production.

I decided to glance at the kitchen since no one was in pizza place at 12:30 (lunch ???), and saw the kitchen help put sausage on my pizza slice with no gloves on. Now what was this weird taste of this slice, Oh the dough was frozen and then baked, the sauce from a bag or can at best and the cheese was tasteless. I am not even mentioning the terrible meat. The place also had a weird smell coming through vents??

I love their healthy selections, their incredible produce department , their beautiful flowers that they have year round.. And all of their products. Here are some of my favorite things: Indian veggie burgers- these are incredible, potato like burgers with a slight hint if curry; they go perfectly with trader joes Mango chutney- which is also incredible. I love their tangerine juice, it's such a nice unique twist on orange juice and super sweet. Trader joes unsweetened vanilla almond milk is the best almond milk I can find. Their meatless mandarin orange chicken is my FAVORITE. I buy it by the dozen. Trader joes is the cheapest place for healthier options like quinoa, coconut milk ice cream and meatless options too. Their meatless ground beef is my favorite. They have amazing customer service and will take back anything if you have your receipt. I have tried a lot of their dried fruits and I bought dried peaches once and hated them- they took them back without even blinking. The only item that I do not prefer from trader joes is their meat items- my boyfriend loves their rib eye, but considering they do not have a butcher on the site, I do not buy their meat.. I don't know how fresh it is and therefore I do not trust it. That's the only reason they have not received 5 stars from me..

When we got to the restaurant, they told us it was going to be about a 15-30 minute wait ... we got our table in about 5 minutes. Good start! We were browsing through the menu & trying to make a decision during which time our waiter came by twice & asked if we had any questions. We said that we still needed a little bit of time but he was helpful in answering questions we had about the menu.\\n\\nWe decided on the Seafood Platter with a lobster bisque & the Crispy Alaskan Salmon. The Crispy Alaskan Salmon was pictured on the front of their menu & it looked like a hearty piece of salmon topped with plump shrimps & scallop on a bed of saut\\u00e9ed spinach ... my plate didn't reflect that. The salmon was cooked great (I had asked for it well done rather than the normal medium-rare to rare) whereas the shrimp were just okay - one was overcooked and one was not. The scallop was really squishy (for a lack of a better word) & the few pieces of crabmeat that were added to the plate were tasteless & could've been left off. Honestly, I think it would've made for a really good dish if the fish was served by itself next to some rice pilaf or steamed vegetables ... I would've much rather preferred that. As far as the Seafood Platter goes, it was your typical fried fish platter, nothing to rave about, even though it cost $27.\\n\\nLastly, it's to be noted that the service left much to be desired. After we had ordered our meals, we were brought a basket of bread and butter ... no silverware. There were two strips of bread in this basket: one which was soft & cut into two pieces and the other one which was not cut & quite hard. We didn't receive any silverware the first time we asked & had to ask again. The waiters caused some commotion at a table nearby after someone had dropped a water cup made of glass on the floor. None of them seemed very on top or quick about getting it cleaned up.\\n\\nWe did round out the evening by getting the bread pudding for dessert (our servers suggestion) & this $5 dessert was probably the best thing we had all evening! Overall, I'd say that if it was worth the money, I would go back to Pappadeaux's for the salmon; based on this experience, however, it's not likely that we'll be going back.", "beginning": "Highly disappointed with our dining experience last night.

{"trgt": "We just got back from a 4 night stay at the Cosmopolitan and I doubt I'll go back.  This hotel fell well short of our expectations.  In short, our room wasn't ready when we arrived, items in our room didn't work, the room had been and continued to be poorly cleaned during our stay, and hotel staff was in general not helpful.\\n\\nUpon arrival, we were informed that they didn't have any rooms available like we reserved and that they didn't know how long it would be before one would be ready.  They tried to up-sell us to another room for $50/night, but we declined and chose to wait for the room we requested to be cleaned and become available.  They gave us keys and informed us that they would call shortly and let us know what our room number is and that our keys would be automatically activated for that room.  After roughly a 2 hour wait, we received the call that our room was ready, but their system to activate the keys wasn't working so we needed to go back to the front desk to get new keys made.  After getting back to the front desk to get new keys made, another attempt was made by the front desk employee to up-sell us to a different room, this time for $30/night.  Again we declined.  However, we were able to talk them into putting us in a room on a higher floor than what they had originally assigned us to (originally assigned us to a room on the 30th floor and we ended up with a room on the 61st floor).\\n\\nAt first glance the room was nice, but the longer we stayed there, the more issues we found.  We found an empty beer can in one of the cabinets within the first 30 seconds of entering the room, but yet the maid didn't seem to be able to find it and dispose of it in the 4 days we stayed there.  The mini bar was missing items.  We worried that this would show up on our bill when we checked out.  It did, but the front desk had no issue taking the item off our bill.  The lights in the room can all be controlled via on/off wall switches or via dimming options through the TV.  It's kind of a neat system except it rarely worked.  After our first night, we were never able to control the lights or any of the other features in the room using the TV.  We were also never able to get the TV in the living room area to come on after the first day.  I suspect the 2 issues were related.  The jacuzzi features in the bath tub didn't work at all.  The maid seemed to come every day we were there, but yet I saw no signs that the room was ever vacuumed while we were there.  The iron in the room had a broken knob on it so you couldn't tell what setting it was on or change the setting.  My other issues with the room get pickier from there so I'll stop.  While this all sounds bad, we didn't stress out about it too much as we really didn't spend that much time in the room to begin with.\\n\\nThe staff at the Cosmopolitan leaves much to be desired as well.  Of the 3 people we had to deal with at the front desk, only 1 was really helpful and pleasant to talk to.  It ended up working out better for us that this didn't happen, but when the front desk called us to tell us our room was ready, they should have also called the bellhop for us to have our bags that we left with them brought up to our room.  Instead, we had to stand in line and deal with the bellhop ourselves.  We rented a car for a day from the Hertz desk inside the hotel.  Upon trying to return the car, no one was working the desk at 11am.  The couple in line in front of us at the Hertz desk waited nearly 35min while hotel staff was dumbfounded as to why someone wasn't working the desk.  We waited about 20min and a couple behind us waited about 10min.  I can't fault the hotel too much for Hertz not doing their job, but the organization and communication among the hotel staff about how to resolve the situation was pathetic.\\n\\nMy girlfriend had ordered a b-day cake from the hotel to be delivered to the room at a specific time and day to surprise me.  This request was confirmed multiple times and the hotel assured her that the cake would be delivered to the room at the time she request.  But, of course, the cake was in fact not delivered at the time she asked for nor anywhere close to the time she asked for.  We don't actually know when it was delivered because we had to leave to make a dinner reservation.  When we returned to the room much later that evening, the cake was sitting there in the room.  No apology or explanation was ever given as to why the cake wasn't delivered when requested.\\n\\nWhile there wasn't any one big incident that really made us dislike our stay at the Cosmopolitan, it was the numerous little things that, at the end of our stay, made us look back and wonder if maybe we should have stayed at a different hotel.  I truly expected more from this Hotel.  Do yourself a favor and stay at another hotel.", "beginning": "We just got back from a 4 night stay at"}

Assorted granite tabletops and faux rock wall decor lend to a Mediterranean feel, as do the bumpin' beats laid behind sultry \\\"Arabic\\\" vocals (I barely speak Spanish) playing overhead (at an interestingly reasonable volume).  \\n\\nOn the large Flatscreen TV which manages to not look TOO out of place, CNN aka The Anderson Cooper Network was broadcasting news of the Libyan uprising.  It strangely juxtaposed with the music, making me wish all news were Autotuned for our enjoyment.\\n\\nThe help was... well, helplful if not all that personable.  He seemed a bit irritated with us although we were the only people in the store and still ended up spending $40 for 3 people (after coupon, but also after the 18% grat was added, which wasn't really a grat, but just more income for the restaurant... meh.)\\n\\nOn to the food:\\n\\nWe ordered Hummus ($2.49), Baba Ghanoush ($1.99), Tabouli ($1.99), and uhh... the yogurt and cucmber sauce/dip (Mast-O-Khiar - $2.49) along with some extra bread ($1.99) to start .  Our \\\"appetizers\\\" came up within about 8-10 minutes and we were off to the races, stuffing our face with as much deliciousness as we could, and it was all delicious!  The hummus had great flavor, and I actually ate Baba Ghanoush and Tabouli, neither of which I normally ever touch.  Even the bread itself was notably tasty, a rare treat and much appreciated!\\n\\nThe main courses were (we all shared):\\nGround Beef Kabob plate ($6.99)\\nGround Chicken Kabob plate ($6.99)\\nGround Lamb Kabob plate ($7.99)\\nTenderloin Chicken Kabob plate ($8.99)\\n\\nALL came with a giant pita (half of a 12\\\"), tons of what they underwhelmingly call \\\"Saffron Rice\\\" (which is actually some of the most attractive, subtly flavorful, and well-cooked rice I've ever had... there's got to be a name for that!  \\\"Wicked Awesome Rice\\\", perhaps?)\\n\\nBoth chicken plates got gobbled up before anyone could discuss  how they'd be divided (Fork Wars!)  On to the beef, which was perfectly seasoned (not OVERseasoned as is alllll too common in Mediterranean places).  Everything was tender, perfectly cooked, and seriously - I can't say enough about their getting the seasoning right.  Finally, a place that doesn't think \\\"Brian needs another cup of salt in him!\\\"\\n\\nIt was late in the day, so I'm going light on the lamb... Yes, Lamb is gamey, but done right and perfectly fresh, it's not as gamey as what I ate (I had to eat most of it - I'm our \\\"garbage disposal\\\"... \\n\\nAfter fulfilling my disposal duties (the lamb wasn't THAT bad... just full of lamb-y flavor!),  on came the dessert - Baklava ($1.99).\\n\\nHow good was it?  We bought phyllo dough, butter, pistachios and honey before we got home after being reminded just how much Baklava can DRIP WITH DELICIOUSNESS!!!  Yes, I licked the honey out of the container - what about it!?\\n\\nFor our $10 tip, we didn't really get any \\\"service\\\", but this isn't that type of place... the open kitchen (awesome) was quick to let us know when our food was up (also awesome).  We considered leaving our disposable everything on the table but opted to haul it to the trash ourselved (darned morals - although we did leave a good bit of rice on the table). \\n\\nOn the way out, we walked past a few bags of trash which hadn't made their way to the dumpster just yet... Nothing \\\"shocking\\\", it was late, they were nearing closing, but really... you can't just take the extra steps to the dumpster when almost no one's in the restaurant?\\n\\nOverall, great place, good specials (not available with Restaurant.com coupon), a little in the middle of nowhere but if you're on Sunset by the \\nairport, there's few places to eat and this is a reaaaally good one.  \\n\\nTheir full menu is on their home page (awesome, and a rare treat... I don't care about your atmosphere and blahhhh.

She asked me how many and I told her it was just me. I felt kind of awkward.  She showed me inside and asked if I wanted to sit at this crammed little bar facing basically a freaking wall.  I asked to be seated somewhere else, as it was really uncomfortable to sit there.  \\n\\nSo, she sat me in another room near the kitchen area.  Did this place used to be a house or something?

I guess it was okay, but not the greatest food Ive sunk my teeth into. I surprisingly was full when I finished.  the chicken was good, but I think the waffles is what got me.

{"trgt": "My visit took place on Jan 01, 2015. I ate at the bar and watched the Rose Bowl.\\n\\nBut also know that I actually sought out this restaurant because more than one professional restaurant reviewer listed Pizza Rock as amongst the \\\"Top 10 Pizzas - 2014\\\" in Las Vegas. In addition, these writers noted that the restaurant has multiple pizza ovens - different ovens to facilitate the production of different styles (Neapolitan, Roma, New York, Chicago...) of pizza, and this caught my interest.\\n\\nSo let's start with the positives:\\n\\nIt has a great location. It is across the street from the Downtown Grand, or one block off of Fremont Street. So if you want to get away from the noise, and casino and chain eateries on Fremont Street without having to drive, it a good option.\\n\\nThe interior is well decorated. If you want to have a nice meal without distractions, you can.  And if you want to sit in an area with views of TV screens to monitor your sports team, you can.\\n\\nThe pricing is very reasonable for a restaurant of this caliber, and the service was also very good.\\n\\nBut with regards to the food.... I can only give \\\"an average\\\" rating based on my one meal.  I ordered the Traditional Neapolitan Margherita pizza, and did not ask for any special customization. I wanted to see what their interpretation was. The pizza was beautiful to look at. But I prefer a dryer, crispier crust. The rim of my pizza's crust was doughy and more like fresh bread. The bottom (flat area) of the crust was \\\"wetter\\\" than I prefer. Maybe this is the new trend. (I also visited \\\"800 Degrees\\\" on the Las Vegas Strip, and experienced the same issue of wet crust.) Perhaps I need to try a different \\\"style\\\" of pizza next time?\\n\\nHere's the bottom line: the place is nice enough that I am willing to go back and try another meal. And having read my review, the staff is friendly enough: you or I can describe the textures we want from our pizza to the server. They can suggest a style of pizza that is to your liking, or they can ask the kitchen to accommodate.

{"trgt": "CAN I GIVE NEGATIVE STARS???????\\nPLEASE READ MY REVIEW\\nI just literally walked out of here 10 mins ago. I am so so so mad at this place i wish i could swear on yelp. First we go in.. Nobody greets us. Then they put ure feet in this plastic bag thing for 20 mins waiting. While we are waiting they are yelling at each other the whole time. I get no relax in vegas and i come to the spa and it is louder than the casino???? Then they say we should do the 35$ massage cuz its better than the 20$. So we say yes. I get massages 3times a week at least(not here). This was by far the worst massage ive ever had and i had hundreds of different people work on me. I went in just cuz it was cheap so i wanted to try it out. The massage was TERRIBLE. Then i go out to pay my friend said lets leave 5$ tip each so 40$ and i said even though they were horrible i cant do that and i try give them 25% tip. They look at the money im handing to them and they look at me and they look disguste with the 25% tip. They tell me everybody tips 20$ or more for the massage. So i tell them the massage is 20$ to 35$ and ppl tip 50% to 100%???????? And they said yes. They said 10$ each is not enough for them cuz they worked hard. Best part! When i handed the money while they looked disgusted at my 25% tip. They said \\\"THATS IT????\\\" How is 10$ tip on a 35$ service get that kind of attitude? Im a good tipper and a nice person. The massage sucked and it was like 30% tip almost i was giving to these rude ppl!!!! So because im a pushover i ended up giving them 35$ on a 70$ bill!! 105$ and they didnt even say thank you.

I couldn't find self parking around so I opted for their valet.  Normally, I would walk rather than pay someone to move my car.  On the valet sign there was no price for the service.  I assumed that it was complimentary and would give a tip.  Well, I got my car, gave what I thought was a decent tip, and was told there is a flat rate.  Luckily, I had just the right amount of cash for the rate, but no extra for the tip.   I could have pulled up, put on my flashers, and made change for them.  I decided not to do this after his reaction to me being unaware there was a flat rate (even though it wasn't on the sign...)

She's in town for a couple of days and Wicked Spoon was on her radar this time around (I swear, she's a Yelper in training).  We purposely arrived about an hour near closing because I figured that the lines wouldn't be as bad then.  I was right, only waited about 20 minutes to get into our seats.  Overall service was great and for that I cannot complain.  I feel the ambiance and the decor.  I even love their tables and wish I had that pattern at home.  But this review is about the food, right? \\n\\nIn my opinion, if you've been to one buffet in Las Vegas, you've been to them all.  The dishes here are served in mini-portions, which I think is great for pictures.  But lousy for a buffet.  When I think buffet, I think as much as I want.  Give their Fried Chicken Wings as an example.  You get two pieces presented in a cute stainless steel strainer.  But if I wanted 6 pieces, I would have to grab 3 of these bad boys, really? How about their Angry Mac N' Cheese.  The portions are small and if I wanted a little more, than I'm grabbing multiple tins of these.  Again, great for photos, but not convenient for eating.  This is pretty much the experience with all their mini-dishest.  By the time I was done, I've tried their fried chicken, roasted chicken, salmon, sushi (don't do it), mac n cheese, and their garlic pizza.  All were just about par with every one else on the strip.  Not bad in taste, not the greatest either.  \\n\\nNow for dessert...This is where Wicked Spoon has their one shining moment.  It's all about desserts here.  From presentation to taste, you really can't go wrong with their desserts. Their macarons weren't that great, but everything else disappeared once it made it to my table.  \\n\\nOverall, I have to give Wicked Spoon just 3 stars because it's just okay compared to the rest of the strip buffets out there. For $35 a person for lunch, I think I could get more bang for my buck outside of the strip.  I'm sure I will eventually be back.

{"trgt": "Well it's been several years since we have eaten at this restaurant. Not since the rigatoni's people owned it. We used to enjoy this place quite a bit as the food was good, patio ambiance was nice, and the service is usually spot on.\\n\\nOnly one Sunday afternoon tried again with the new ownership and left a bit disappointed. As mentioned above, the Trinity of restaurant experience of ambiance, food and service are necessary for good experience; however, if one is missing, and drastically missing here, experience is just marred.\\n\\nWe took a seat on the patio and were not greeted for 15 min. yes 15 full minutes sitting alone like hobo Joes. I kind of felt like leaving and going next door to dos gringos. The server finally approached was far from enthusiastic seemed like almost annoyance to her to be waiting tables this afternoon. Almost zombielike, probably just hung over. In fact all the service staff that I viewed seem to have this zombielike hangover.\\n\\nAnyhow, I asked her about the bloody Mary's and they were good as I assume they should be a roadhouse and she said, \\\"the other awesome this bartender makes a really good.\\\" I smiled and happily agreed and waited in anticipation for this bloody Mary of greatness. She left and we see her again for almost 15 min. which is absurd. When she did come back to the table she didn't have my drink she just wanted to take the food order simply said, \\\"you ready?\\\" Not much the menu lead huh. She took our food order and didn't offer an appetizer before leaving so I had to call her back to order one. Still no bloody Mary.\\n\\nWhen the bloody Mary did arrive we have been seated for about 27 min. yes 27 min. to get a drink. What's more disappointing is how awful the drink was. I'm not particularly picky as I felt you can't really mess up a bloody Mary but they sure did. Came out in a small plastic tumbler glass and literally tasted like tomato juice with barely any spice in it and no garnish whatsoever. It looked really sad and tasted sad. What really pissed me off was about 15 feet away there was a couple of guys seating at the bar who have bloody Mary's in glass pint glasses with a salted rim and a bunch of garnishes with some celery stalk and you can see from the color of the drink that it was made like a bloody Mary. REALLY!! It really sucks and I totally felt cheated. Restaurants without consistency drive me crazy. A Big Mac in Boston is the same as a Big Mac in San Diego. Your drinks and food should be the same. \\n\\nThe food runner or cook came to our table with an appetizer of sliders and said, \\\"your sliders.\\\" I told him that we an order that that we ordered shrimp and he said, \\\"what you mean?\\\" I found that almost comical statement as it reiterated to him that we had ordered shrimp not sliders. About 5 min. later shrimp came out. This is where I have a hard time deciphering between two and three stars for this place because the food is really good. The Cajun shrimp drunken appetizer was outstanding. I even thought of ordering one to go for later on.\\n\\nI had a Rubin and my mom had meatloaf. My mom's diabetic and can have a lot of sugar and the meatloaf came out with huge blobs of barbecue sauce on it. I'm not sure that was my mistake and I didn't read the menu correctly but I don't think I would have missed that. Anyhow we scraped off the barbecue sauce and my mom absolutely love smoky flavored meatloaf she commented about three times how good it was. My Reuben sandwich also was very good with an ample stacking of meat which I appreciated. Coleslaw was obviously fresh and had a good flavor but lacked the will of the seasoning and punch. Again food was outstanding. No doubt about that.\\n\\nAfter the appetizer was served I had seen that they have Corona light on tap so I ordered one. 20 min. to get a beer and I was nearly finished with my meal when it came. This is stupid.\\n\\nThe only other negative was that the facility needs a bit of a facelift noticed was the same furniture from four or five years ago and it's starting to show.\\n\\nBottom line I probably won't go back because I can't deal with atrocious service.", "beginning": "Well it's been several years since we have eaten at"}

Kristen and I went with our three favorite couples to celebrate an engagement, we decided to arrive at six thirty because they do not take reservations (I will never understand why restaurants choose to not accept them). Once seventy five percent of your party is there you get a little buzzer and your name on the list. \\n      We found our friends sitting at the outside bar and joined them for some drinks. The bar is pretty awesome, there were several bartenders, so you never needed more than a little eye contact for quick service, and they have a ton of beers and specialty cocktails on the menu, from fruity and sweet to harsh and alocoholy. The seats were fairly plentiful and comfy, and there are also lounge seats all around the bar area for the outside dining, I thought the layout and design was attractive and used the limited space wisely, I'd love to come back for an outside lunch. The bartenders and waiters were friendly and attentive, all good looking (of course, Scottsdale) and all of our drinks (from beers to martinis to fruity stuff) were delicious and not too overpriced, I mean, they were overpriced, but not quite Scottsdale overpriced. So far, so good. We paid the tab and headed inside. \\n      The atmosphere inside is awesome. I hope to someday open a restaurant, so when I enter a new business I eat it up, I devour the place, I pick apart the ambiance, the lighting, the noise level, the architecture and design, everything, and I really like Culinary Dropout. The tables are huge, slabs of hard, rough wood, very rustic and western, it is dimly lit with modern (not too loud) music playing, there is a surprising amount of room and lots of space for big party's, they have a stage for live music (awesome), Culinary Dropout really surprised me. \\n      I will spare critiquing each meal and just stick with Kristen and I's, but just to be fair, two in our group had the beer battered fish and chips, one had the pub burger, one had the fried chicken and two had the shaved prime rib dip, and none complained. \\n      Our group shared both the house potato chips, which were very tasty and fried just right, and the onion dip was flavorful, not some run of the mill dip, and the soft pretzel and provolone fondue, which was fantastic. A pretzel is kind of a pretzel, they were good, soft and all, but the provolone sauce simply exploded, man it was good, creamy and tasty, you should definitely try it. I ordered the fried chicken, which was delectable, it had a great but not overdone crunch, it was sweet and you could actually taste the spices, not just the taste of the fryer, you also get a lot of it, three big, juicy, tender pieces. It came with a side of mashed potatoes and gravy which was good enough, nothing special, but only had two bites in it, and two very small but scrumptious biscuits with honey. Dear Kristen had the shaved prime rib dip which was fine, a little disappointing I guess, just not much meat, the meat to bread ratio was severely lacking, and it came with fries which were very good. If you're really in the mood for a prime rib sandwich, head to Houston's. \\n      I will be back here for sure. I paid for Kristen and I, plus the newly engaged couple, and including drinks and all food it only came to ninety eight dollars, that is a bargain for this atmosphere and the overall quality of the food and staff.

Due to the loudness of the loudspeaker, i had to seek refuge in an area of the building where i could hear my phone call. Considering the policy on exiting the back door was changed today, i was forced to stand in the area to the east of the rear door to hear my phone call, rather than walking across the the building to exit the front door.\\n\\nI was approached by a guy with a walkie talkie who interrupted my phone call to tell me to leave the area i was in. I moved a few feet to away and was immediately approached again and ushered back into the area where hearing the phone call was not possible. I made my way to another area and was ushered away by the same guy, mind you im on a business call with a client in North Dakota. After struggling to hear my client for at least 5 minutes, I ended the call. The entire time i was on the call, the guy was watching me as if i was trying to steal something. I felt unwanted at this place so i packed up my pit and unregistered from the race. \\n\\nI went to the hobby shop for a refund, since my car hadn't touched the track. Yet again met another rude, pissed off employee who seemed burdened by my request, and denied my refund due to not being sure if I practiced......I advised the situation I just encountered, and nothing was said from the employee. I said keep the money and left... \\n\\nDo yourself a favor, avoid this place and go elsewhere.

We ordered 5 dishes and they gave us only 5 scoops of rice for a party of 5 adults + 2 kids. We asked for more rice and to find out on our tab, it was $1.99 per scoop. \\n-On the menu it says \\\"15% auto gratuity for a party of 6+\\\" they auto gratuity us even when we had 2 kids (2 & 5 years old) to my knowledge in the state of Nevada auto gratuity is not allowed anymore. I didn't complain this time because we would have gave a large tip anyways. \\n-some of the TV's need to be changed out.\\n\\nWhat I did like was they had a private banquet room that fits about 100 people.

{"trgt": "The hubs and I decided to try this place out on a particularly icky rainy Sunday afternoon. Perhaps because the weather was gross or that we came smack in the middle of the afternoon, Bang Bang was really quiet. It gave me a chance to appreciate their decor and choice of music (Sinatra was on). It's a nice, cozy place with a warm interior. I dig that. \\n\\nWe tried the cheeseburger eggrolls, the Hangover with regular fries, and the Brie burger with sweet potato fries. We were really surprised at how well the cheeseburger eggrolls turned out. My only advise there is to make sure you order enough and wait a moment for them to cool. Hubs had the Hangover burger and let me try a bite. I liked it. I wish it just had a couple pieces of crispy whole bacon to round it off. My Brie burger was awesome. The tomato jam was sweet and mellow which really complements the brie and arugula. Normally I don't dig big wads of greens on my burger, but this stack was well balanced and tender, so it was pleasant. I think my one regret was getting a single because the Duke's Bread buns are a little too bulky to carry just one patty. Then again, I couldn't even finish my food (which is saying a lot considering I'm a fluffy girl in the Gabriel Iglesias sense), so that's probably more reflective of the bun just being too big. All these were good.......but the sweet potato fries with maple sauce....those were great. I can't really pin down why the sauce is so perfect. It's sweet, but it's not frosting sweet. It's tangy, but not ketchup tangy. Ugh, IDK, but it's delicious with the salted sweet potato fries. The regular fries are top notch too, but getting great regular fries has really become a standard expectation these days. I like that this place offers so many healthy options too. It makes feeding a mixed palate group much easier (though you won't catch me wolfing down broccoli with garlic oil any time soon; in fact, that's the only thing GHWB and I agree on politically: no broccoli. I don't like it. Well except for Chinese broccoli, but that's another post.). \\n\\nSo final opinion is that this is definitely the best burger joint we've seen in CLT so far, but it could use a few improvements like smaller buns for singles and a build your own burger option on the menu.", "beginning": "The hubs and I decided to try this place out"}

From what I understand, the acts for the show change from time to time.  The friends I went with remarked that the show, and even the stage (if one can even dumb the extravagant setting down to a single word), had metamorphosed since their last visit.\\n\\nAll I know is that I don't remember ever witnessing this level of athleticism and choreography in a show in... ever.  I liken it to some old-school Cirque shows I've seen in the past... on crack.  With disjointed acts, tied tenuously together by the theme of a dream, there are very few points where there isn't a smorgasbord of activity to feast your eyes on.  And the entire intimate space is used -- from the depths of the water to the dizzying heights of an out-of-sight ceiling, and from wall to wall.  There's doesn't seem to be a single cube of space that isn't involved in the show in some way.\\n\\nAnd that doesn't even touch upon the modular, insane, hydraulic contraption that serves a variety of purposes.

{"trgt": "It appeared very obvious that Red Velvet Cafe would win me over, upon the moment we arrived- due to their lovely decor, likely furnished by IKEA. The modern bar stools & high tops were aesthetically pleasing. Unfortunately, not very practical when dining in such a confined area. I couldn't really get comfortable while eating, which was a turn off, at first.\\n\\nTo start out, we ordered \\\"Chicken/ Vegan Nuggets\\\". When I read this on the menu, I thought \\\"Oh cool, you have an option to get either chicken or vegan style\\\". Apparently, I was very wrong. Our vegan nuggets were average, definitely not chicken, but not horrific either. I really enjoyed the tangy red sauce that they were served beside. I'm still kicking myself for not asking what it was- I wanna go with...something vinegar based?!\\n\\nFor our main course, my boyfriend & I shared the Buffalo Chicken Wrap. I wasn't really sold on this when we ordered it. Not because I'm shy about spicy things, but because its described as \\\" Lettuce, Tomato, Buffalo Sauce, Ranch and Cheese\\\" (I mean really, how exciting can you be, Buffalo Chicken Wrap?). Despite its very bland description, there are so many complements it deserves! First of all, you know when you're eating a wrap & its hard to take bites without pieces of lettuce, meat, or other veggies escaping because they are too long? How about chopped lettuce (no yucky iceberg pieces) mixed with cheese, lightly covered in ranch & cubed grilled chicken tossed in buffalo sauce- all cozy in a wheat wrap. Very easy to eat, without excess food particles falling out! I also loved the fact that it was served with baked chips. I give this wrap 4 stars!\\n\\nLets get down to my favorite part of every meal...DESSERT! So, you can't go to the Red Velvet Cafe without ordering Red Velvet Cake. No regrets there, at all. Although I was very shocked when I found out that the entire piece of cake that I consumed was only 150 calories (not that I'm couting) AND completely vegan!!! It tasted like a heart attack, although its significantly less volatile than that Little Debbie Snack Trash your mom put in your lunch box. Without a doubt, the best red velvet that I've ever experienced. The frosting was heavenly, the cake was rich, & the strawberry on top- refreshing.\\n\\nWill I return to Red Velvet Cafe?

{"trgt": "Okay Radio Milano, I have a confession to make.  I have secretly and unfairly harbored borderline hatred in my heart for you since you overtook the space that once held my favorite Italian restaurant, Pronto's.  I know hate is a strong word, but that is truly how I felt for almost two years.  However, that all changed, last Saturday night.  Radio Milano, can you ever forgive me?\\n\\nYou know how you secretly spy on an ex after you break up, just to see what they're up to so you don't get blindsided one day by showing up at the same place.  You know the scenario, you're alone and they are there... looking as fabulous as ever... with their new someone...who also looks as fabulous as ever and the situation is more than...awkward?  Well, in the interest of full disclosure, I've been following @radioMILANO on twitter for awhile now, silently cursing them every time they posted some wonderful looking creation from their kitchen that just made my mouth water.  Yes, I still miss Pronto's.  So after I saw their Saturday Chalkboard Surf and Turf Special, I decided to be the bigger person, put on a happy face, and confront my inner demon.  It took me two weeks to work up the courage (actually, we had prior commitments for 2 weekends), but finally, we made it!  And am I glad we did!\\n\\nFirst let me say, that once inside, I was completely shocked at the renovation that had taken place.  I did not recognize the space at all, save the arched ceilings.  The ambiance is amazing.  I totally felt like a hipster in an old school Rat Pack flick.  The place just wreaked, \\\"Coolness\\\"!  We were promptly seated upon our arrival. We ordered our drinks; I had a glass of wine, my wife had a mixed drink (something pink) that resembled a cosmo, but made with pomegranate juice.  We looked over the menu, even though we were there for the special and found many things we would have otherwise enjoyed, had we not been there for the surf and turf.\\n\\nWe started with an order of the deviled eggs.  Can I just say that these were THE BEST deviled eggs I've ever had?  The consistency of the yolk was more of an egg salad, and the flavors were incredible.  We just finished with our appetizer when our main course arrived.  The presentation was excellent!  The petite lobster tail was cooked to perfection, as was the petite filet!  The steamed broccoli was not overdone and the mashed potatoes were amazing!  Unfortunately, we didn't get to sample the dessert menu because we were both stuffed!\\n\\nIt was a pleasure to meet the person behind the @radioMILANO twitter account.  He's a very nice guy.  Yes, I remember his name, but since he doesn't have it posted on his twitter account, I won't post it here.  We really enjoyed our night out at Radio Milano and can't wait to return.

{"trgt": "Some people are going to view this as a one star hotel and others are going to view it as a five star... it's all about what you are looking for.\\n\\n1 star... if you are looking for any semblance of the typical Las Vegas experience.\\n\\n5 star... if you don't want to be anywhere near the action, are looking for a relaxed location and spot, and are probably there with your family.\\n\\nNormally I would rate something for being what it is, but the problem in this case is false advertising that gets people here when it's not exactly what they are looking for (at least in our case).\\n\\nFor starters, \\\"on the Las Vegas Strip\\\" in the name of the hotel itself is pretty misleading.  This is a LOOSE definition of the word strip because it's about as far as you can get from the main strip and still be on the strip.  I'd say it was 5 miles to the Venetian / Bellagio etc area.   Sure, we should have done our due diligence and researched this, but my sister had seen one of the locations which was closer to the center of the strip and assumed it was that one when she booked it, not knowing there are 5 different Hilton properties in and around the strip.\\n\\nThey told her she was getting a very special discounted rate for attending a timeshare presentation, but upon checking the advertised rates, it was about the same. Also, the rates weren't any cheaper than the rest of the strip for that weekend, so it's not like we were getting a discount for being far from the action either.\\n\\nThis really got me.. you have to PAY for parking every day.. and the parking lot is not exactly attached to the hotel. The first 4-5 levels are reserved for valet and are totally empty, so it's a bit annoying having to circle around and around empty spaces to get to ones you can park in.  One of the things about Vegas is free parking everywhere, but such is not the case here.\\n\\nNo Casino / Smoke, etc.. points plus for this.\\n\\nGym - Okay, normally people in Vegas don't exactly make it to the gym. But the types of people that stay somewhere like this are the types that are going to go to  the gym... so there should be more than 4 elliptical machines.  Waiting in line for an hour was not ideal. The gym is WAY too small for the capacity.\\n\\nThe walls are pretty thin and we could hear whatever the people next door were watching on TV at all hours.\\n\\nWe called down for more blankets, more toiletries and a toothbrush, and had a blanket thrown in our room with no other stuff.  Literally.. they knocked on the door and we were in bed and getting up to go answer it when we heard the door fly open, the blanket be thrown in, and the door slammed shut. Jeez.\\n\\nAll in all, this hotel is adequate.  I get if people want to be away from the strip, but there's not need to be SO far from it that you don't even feel like you are in Vegas. The gym is not great, but it does have a few good machines with TVS.  The rooms are clean and spacious and as advertised, albeit with thin walls.\\n\\nSo I'd say.. make sure you know what you are looking for, and that this is it.

{"trgt": "My wife and I were sent on a famous \\\"Starbucks Run\\\" last Saturday for the family. We remembered the new location, and were super excited to be able to check it out. However, when we got there we were less than pleased. As mentioned, this Starbucks definitely is not as fast as others, but we felt that was excusable, because it is a brand new location; they probably have some kinks to work out. But what was not excusable was the MESS (also mentioned in another review, barista area was filthy, covered in spills. It didn't seem like anyone was worried about cleaning up either.) and the HORRIBLE customer service. Curtis was making our drinks, and he clearly can not handle a stressful situation, which probably means he shouldn't be working at Starbucks; but that's beyond the point. We ordered just 5 drinks (no crazy orders, either) and the location at this time was not to busy (7PM on a Saturday); every employee looked confused and were clearly lacking communication skills with each other. As the drinks came up (slowly) I started grabbing them to get them out of the way, and as I grabbed a drink, Curtis shouted rudely, \\\"YOUR WELCOME.\\\" with a roll of the eyes. I then went up for the last drink, and asked if we could get a drink carrier; instead of making any eye contact, Curtis sighed, and shouted \\\"NOW WE NEED A DRINK CARRIER, CAN SOMEONE GET IT.\\\" a manager shouts back that they are out, so he turns to us and shrugs his shoulders while saying \\\" We're out.\\\" Thankfully a manager offered us a box, because clearly Curtis wasn't concerned. Getting frustrated, we thanked the manager and made a comment referencing Curtis' lack on interest in helping us, and his response (in front of the manager) was \\\" SORRY FOR OUR BUSYNESS. THANKS, BYE.\\\" Not only am I appalled that an employee would ever treat a customer like this; I am completely shocked that an manager would not address the issue, and apologize for her employees lack of social skills. This Starbucks needs managers that know how to manage and keep their employees under control. So far, I am completely turned off from this location. And it seems as if I am not the only one; as we were leaving another customer made a comment to us asking, \\\"What was up with that?

{"trgt": "I've never had such a heartbreaking experience in my life with any store/restaurant/customer service establishment.  I'm not even a yelp kind of person, but I'm writing this review, my first ever, in hopes I save even one person from the stress this store has put on me.\\n\\nI'm my best friend's maid of honor and she chose to purchase her wedding dress and have her bridesmaids buy their dresses through this store.  It just so happens that my brother is also getting married, and using the same bridesmaid dress designer as my friend, so I figured I could kill two birds with one stone and order both dresses through Lillian Lottie.  From the beginning my experience was horrible.  Though there were a few saleswomen who were quite kind and competent over the phone (I do not live in Phoenix, so my transactions were all over the phone), the majority have no idea what they are doing.  Most times I called I would be put on hold til I was eventually hung up on, put through to the wrong person, or told that the salesperson was unavailable and would return my call. (Obviously I understand that a client in store is more important than a phonecall, so returning my call seems totally reasonable. But she never took down my name/number.  ...That info is kind of essential to return a call, isn't it?)\\n\\nNext problem: the ordering of the dresses.  I will spare the long-winded details of this next part, but in a nutshell, my dresses were both tremendously too large.  I understand that bridal sizes are different than street clothes, but considering the fact that my measurements were sent to them from a tailor, and that the designer of the dress had a website that said my measurements should have equalled a 10, I found it quite odd that they were insisting on my purchasing a 14.  Listening to the woman on the phone, I agreed.  Huge mistake.  The dresses showed up at my door and when I tried them on I looked like a lady on the cover of People magazine wearing her clothes after she had lost 100lbs.  I called Lillian Lottie devastated begging for a return and reorder, and they said it was too late, there was nothing they could do, and that they stood by their size chart. The designer couldn't possibly make a new one in time. \\nTurns out every single other bridesmaid had the same issue with their dresses. (Though none as severe as mine, and unfortunately none of them had purchased TWO dresses.) After much stress on the sweet bride (who eventually removed her purchased wedding dress from Lillian Lottie and took it to be tailored at another place... oh, did I mention they originally ordered her the wrong dress? I suppose I will save that for her yelp post...) we managed to get a little bit of money back from Lillian Lottie for the alterations.  They even admitted that they messed up with my sizes specifically.  So I took the two dresses to a local, well-respected tailor and awaited the alterations.  Today I picked up my dresses...\\n\\n...They look horrible. The tailor did a beautiful job working with what she could.  She basically had to recreate the two gowns, but there was nothing much she could do... they look like completely different dresses.  I'm so upset with Lillian Lottie because rather than just admitting from the beginning that they may have miscalculated sizing they could have returned the dresses to the designer and get a smaller size.  Instead they were too bent on being \\\"right\\\" and said there wouldn't have been enough time.  (I even contacted a higher up from the actual dress designer, and they were appalled that Lillian Lottie claimed it couldn't be done at the time this first issue with Lillian Lottie occurred.)\\n\\nMy best friend's wedding next week.  The dress looks disgusting, but it is what it is.  My brother's wedding is in October, so I'm hoping I can work with the designer and figure something out.  It may seem odd that though this debacle has been going on for several months, that I'm only posting this now.  However picking the dresses up from the tailor today and looking at the dresses hanging next to me right now,  knowing that it is over $500 worth of dresses that I will never wear again is enraging.  They should pay for both of these dresses.  But they won't.  They have my money and I'm out of their hair, so why would they?  So basically I'm writing this post to warn you ladies out there... do not shop at this establishment.\\n\\nWorst part is I'm engaged. I'm having a humongous wedding in Phoenix in May.  I have yet to buy my dress or choose the bridesmaids dresses.  Not only will I be taking my business elsewhere, I will make it a priority to inform any one I can to never shop at this place.\\n\\nTo Lillian Lottie:  I expected more. You seemed to have class.  Sadly, I was proven otherwise and unfortunately I'm the only one suffering from it.  Two dresses and over $500 down the drain.  And please don't respond with a snarky comment, Lillian Lottie, why I'm wrong and you're right.

{"trgt": "I like this hotel but I don't love it as my stay was nice but I don't think I'd stay here again. Not that there's anything particularly wrong with this Trump hotel, it just doesn't feel like it should be in Las Vegas.\\n\\nThe location is a couple of blocks off the Strip which can be a good or a bad thing, depending on what you want from your stay in Vegas. Its easy to drive elsewhere if you have a car, and a cab ride will cost $15-20 to the farthest reaches of the strip like the Mandalay Bay, and much less for hotels that are closer. \\n\\nFor those with a car this hotel has valet only, although it is free (included in the resort fee). The valet staff was hard-working and was always friendly and professional on both drop-off and pickup.\\n\\nThis is also a non-smoking resort, although there were a few people smoking in the pool area (wtf). \\n\\nThe pool was OK but nothing to write home about. Lounge chairs were plentiful and comfortable, but the pool only went 4ft. deep, kinda lame for someone well over 6ft. tall. There were also two hot tubs, one on either side of the pool, but they close at 6pm (another wtf). The final wtf is for them playing loud, annoying, radio music over speakers that are placed so far apart that it sounds like you are listening to the same song twice, only one of them is playing a half second after the other. For me pools are for relaxing, not for partying, but I could see others differing form my opinion.\\n\\nThere is only one restaurant in this hotel and I didn't have a chance to try it. The menu looked like standard American hotel cuisine (boring) so I ventured out to other hotels and also away from the Strip to satisfy my culinary urges. \\n\\nThe lounge next to the restaurant is only open until Midnight on Sundays. Not sure about other days.\\n\\nFinally, the rooms were very good but with a few downsides. I stayed in the basic room (forget the actual name of the suite but it was the lowest priced room). It was indeed huge and well appointed with a well-sized water closet (walk-in shower), separated toilet closet, dual-vanity sink, and large jacuzzi tub. Everything in the bathroom was great except the shower head had some crust on it and could have used a second shower head, or just a better shower head that had a bigger coverage area (again, I'm a large human and so I prefer a shower that covers more than a few square inches of my body at a time).\\n\\nThe bed was comfortable but not super comfortable (could have been softer). It creaked a bit as I imagine thousands of people have already had sex in it, with thousands more to do so in the future (hey, its Las Vegas). There were also a few chips on the wood bed frame and the mattress was a few inches too short for the frame. The pillows were super soft and collapsed just how I like. The sheets were also very soft.\\n\\nThe AC worked fine but there was a large paint chip on the exhaust grill. \\n\\nThe view of the strip was great, but be warned, you can still hear car traffic and police/ ambulance sirens form the street, even way up on the 59th floor. The windows were double pained but were not at all completely sound-proof like they should have or could have been. Its obvious that they cut corners when designing and/ or building this tower,\\n\\nAdditionally, some airplanes taking off from the McCarren turn and fly directly overhead Trump which may or may not bother you.\\n\\nRoom entrances are side by side sharing a common entrance, so its like having two doors to your room.

{"trgt": "We rolled up to the state fair on a fine Sunday afternoon.  I was well hydrated and ready for an evening of debauchery involving barnyard animals, deep fried GARBAGE, shitty domestic beer in a plastic cup, and \\\"amusement\\\" rides.  Zed and Nickels were on the buddy system, I was their backup buddy, the third wheel on the tricycle of fun, 3-dub for short.\\n\\nIs it sad that the best thing I can say about the State Fair is that with enough beer it becomes tolerable?  I discovered that I am not a big fan of deep fried sweets.  Maybe I'm just not in the right space for it, but most of the food options at the Fair looked uniformly gross.  Nickels went gaga over the bunny rabbits while I had a staring contest with a turkey.  Man turkeys are a lot of ugly to pack into one bird.  I'm not sure I can continue to eat something that ugly, because if you are what you eat, well let's just say it's not going to be pretty and leave it at that.\\n\\nYou would think the funhouse type attractions would be more fun with a few beers but honestly they just weren't. I wanted them to be, but there was nothing scary or really all that interesting about them.  The sky rail thing was a little fun altough I felt a little silly sitting up there without skis on and you can imagine my disappointment when the ride did not end at the top of a mountain.\\n\\nWe successfully avoided a Doughtry concert, which made me happy, but there was some sort of frightening pre-teen dance troup trainwreck that we ended up in front of at some point.  We tried to make light of it.  I tried to remember the hilarity of Donnie Darko's little sister's dance troup.  I made a half hearted attempt at telling Zed that sometimes I doubt his commitment to Sparklemotion but it was no use.  Nickels brought up the fact that somewhere in the audience there was probably a pedophile or two taking in the show and it was all down hill from there.

We decided to make the plan happen one night and were excited to get out, as we hadn't been to the movies in a long time. \\n\\nWe decided to sit at the bar at CPK because we were watching the World Cup. The bar area is probably not the most popular spot in the whole restaurant, because it only sits like 10 patrons, but we took a chance. Our bartender was a little strange. He mentioned that he doesn't drink repeatedly and it made ordering drinks a little awkward. At one point, we ordered a lemon drop shot and we asked if he could make them. He said they had a martini and he could just pour it into two glasses. Sure. Ok. Fine. I guess that works. It turns out he made each one of us a martini in a rocks glass and charged us for two martinis. This is not what we asked for. And next time, we'll just ask for a table so the bartender who doesn't drink won't make us feel weird about ordering drinks.\\n\\nI believe our meal was good, I just can't get over the lemon drop shot/martini confusion.

You want it to hug your mouth with flavor on a cold day... not remind you of the flavors your taste buds can't find. Like kissing an old boyfriend you thought your feelings would return and then.... Nothing but little shreds of disappointment. \\n\\nSo why three stars? I've eaten at Nicky's other times and the service is excellent also a second dish I'm reviewing here fared a bit better than my lacking Massaman. \\n\\nRoom for improvement: I couldn't taste the hints of tamarind, cinnamon, garlic or nutmeg or mace. Which should be key stars of the paste. My meal was prepped and brought to me fast but also means it probably was in part pre made. The results were more of a generic salt peanut tasting sauce. More of something I've had on satay. \\n\\nThey used dry red pepper in the sauce which is fine for the paste but it lowers the hot spice flavor. Using oil or fresh red pepper will fix that fast. In addition to the dried pepper I ordered it at a 7 spice level but personally it felt like a 4 or 5 tops. I do not eat spicy food often so my tolerance is not high. \\n\\nThe better dish -- my boyfriend's pumpkin tofu curry was a better bet and really I think Nicky's pleases better with its non traditional dishes. The pumpkin was soft and sauce a nice middle between sweet and spicy. Sadly the spice level was missing like a thief in the night..... No sweat beads made an appearance. The tofu was chewy but not underdone which is a tofu fear of mine ( texture fears). \\n\\nOverall it's gorgeous in here and you get about 4 inches more elbow room than the Western st location.

{"trgt": "Well, I must say I was quite impressed with this place. It almost got a four star rating from me, and that's VERY rare. As always, I checked up on Yelp and also the Maricopa County health inspections site to make sure this place wasn't a liability waiting to happen to my stomach. Seemed quite legit from what I read, so I joined in with group of workmates for lunch yesterday. The parking spots out the front are absolutely ridiculous and appear impossible to park a car in - if you had a regular sedan in one of the spaces, its butt would literally be on the sidewalk and about a half yard from the kerb. Just plain weird. So we parked around the corner in front of a minimart and walked back. Interior is nice and clean, I was sort of expecting it to be more on the dingy side. It's one of those place-order-at-counter-and-they-bring-it-to-your-table places. Fairly limited menu, but then again it's a cheesesteak joint, not Claim Jumper.\\n\\nI ordered the Coronado minus the peppers. Plenty of the items appear to have jalapenos or habaneros, and once upon a time that'd have been just fine with me, but I've softened over the years. I got a side of fries and a drink. The food took a while to be made; not too long, maybe about 15 mins? They certainly didn't seem to be goofing off in the kitchen though. Out came the food and I was very pleasantly surprised. I'm not one of these wankers who walk in already predisposed against a place, ready to start judging how sh1t is done in \\\"Philly\\\" or \\\"Chicago\\\" and who wind up missing the point completely (see my highly-rated review of the now-closed Frank-N-Steins in Surprise for more rage on this subject *8-), I was simply there to have a good meal.

I'm not really a \\\"crisp fries\\\" guy, but.. these were good.\\n\\nThe only thing bringing my rating down to the usual average is the price. My whole sandwich was $9.75 plus tax. And an additional $2.50 for the fries and drink. That's just a little too expensive for lunch. I've had burritos as big as my forearm packing just as much flavour for $5.95, and while I get the whole \\\"it's super delightful, ultra-quality, hand-chopped ribeye\\\" thing, ten bucks for a mid-sized hoagie regardless of whether or not it contains sauteed unicorn nuts is too steep to make me want to return as frequently as I otherwise would. Weird how a half is $8 and a whole is a buck senny five more. Seems almost like movie popcorn pricing to me.\\n\\nDon't get me wrong, this was probably the best cheesesteak I've ever eaten and everyone I was with agreed, and it's a surprisingly neat little establishment where you might actually want take out-of-town tie-wearers for lunch, but it's just a tad on the pricey side IMO.", "beginning": "Well, I must say I was quite impressed with this"}

When I arrived the restaurant wasn't packed, but there was a few people and no line.  \\n\\nI really struggled to give this place 4 stars.  The reason was because the girl at the counter was really rude.  This was the first time I have ever been here and was asking some questions.  She seemed annoyed and just wanted to take my order.  I was upset because there wasn't anybody behind me.  After asking a few questions I finally gave up and realized she was visibly upset.

The place had been other restaurants before and other than some cheesy Greek mural nothing was done. The table I was at felt like it had never been scrubbed and the benches and chairs are worn out.\\n\\nThe service was inexcusably bad, and the waitress didn't wash her hands. I know this because I followed her through the front door and never saw her wash her hands. At least until after she brought drinks she was never out of sight. She was also not very knowledgable of the menu, I asked \\\"what is in your Greek salad?\\\" And she says generic 'you know, lettuce and feta cheese and stuff' and then launches into an explanation of feta cheese. I had to ask her 2 more times before I could even get a real answer. She never offered up any specials, but when asked she told us, but one in particular was a \\\"beef casserole\\\" and \\\"they put seasonings in it to be delicious\\\" but nothing more. Ugh she was just lousy, had no table presence and did not own her role in the customer-server relationship. \\n\\nThe food was...eh, ok. Barely. Nothing tasted fresh at all.  It is still the summer and the tomatoes were lousy. The tzatziki sauce was just yogurt, no pepper or cucumber was discernible. The pita was tasteless and closing in on stale. The lamb meat was so overwhelmingly seasoned with oregano and something else I couldn't taste the lamb, but at least it was hot.  And the \\\"Greek fries\\\" were a joke. You can't sprinkle a minuscule amount of dried oregano on fries and call them Greek. \\n\\nOh and the kids meals were a let down. A healthy pile of meat on a pita, no sauce, no tomato, nothing. Nobody wants a dry gyro, not even kids.\\n\\n2 stars instead if 1 for 2 reasons. Even though the kids meal gyro was lousy it was still a great value and once we got some sauce they were edible.

I just stumbled upon this place because I had a late night craving for burger, was in the Venetian at the time, and needed something to absorb the big pomegranite martini I had earlier.  It's in the Venetian food court and is open really late.  I was a little turned off that it cost $11.50 for a mushroom swiss burger, but you have to expect that with anything on the Strip.  The burger was surprisingly good though and it satisfied my craving for the night.  Thinking that it was a fluke for that night, I came back again the next night and ordered the same thing.  It was still good, just as good as some of the upscale burger joints on the strip.  Would I go back again?

{"trgt": "Wow, what a yummy dinner! For the Yelp ISC UYE this month our fearless leaders Ursula and Monica selected Caf\\u00e9 Ga Hyang and what a great choice it was. I decided to be brave and order the octopus with noodles however our waitress (who I deducted from her brazen attitude is also the proprietor) talked me into the squid instead (sans noodles). The squid turned out to be a great choice since it was delicious! It was pretty spicy but not so much that it made your mouth hurt. Just some good heat and fantastic flavor. My hubby and mom accompanied me and to my surprise they both enjoyed their meals from the bbq section of the menu. Hubby got the spare ribs and Mom got the shrimp. Those two plates were not spicy but had really good flavor as well. In addition we all got white rice and all the usual Banchan (side dishes) including Kimchi. I did not sample all of them since it was just a ton of food but my favorite was the tofu dish.\\n\\nThe three of us agreed that the best thing we ate that night was the appetizer I ordered. Unfortunately I forgot the name but it was basically a plate of small, round, shrimp dumplings. The description in the menu said they were fried but they weren't super greasy or breaded or anything so I think they mean pan fried and not deep fried. They had the sweetest tasting shrimp in them and the wrapper just tasted like butter. They just melted in your mouth. The sauce that accompanied them was also delicious and unlike anything I had ever had before. It was red with a color and texture almost like tomato sauce. It tasted like it had some chili in it but it was sweet and also had some garlic and other savory flavors in there. It was so delectable that my mom wanted to keep it to put it on her bowl of rice that came with her entr\\u00e9e but our server informed us that was not the right way to eat it.  Too bad, because that sauce was fantastic!\\n\\nCaf\\u00e9 Ga Hyang has really made me a fan of Korean food and if it was closer to where I lived I definitely would be back.

It just holds the flavor better.  And when they ask you how spicy, they actually mean it. The medium is pretty decently spicy.  So impressive since it's hard to actually get something to be spicy here in Phoenix.  I can only imagine how spicy hot is.  Been here three times and I still crave it. \\nOk, on to other things I've tried several things and so far only one thing wasn't all that great but everything else has been.\\nThe causa rellena with imitation crab would be the one thing i say to avoid. My friend and I didnt think it was all that great esp. The arroz con pollo was yummy. The carapulcra is a pork stew and is like a comfort food. \\nIf you like spicy, make sure to ask for the aji rocoto - Peruvian hot sauce/salsa. So yummy. It adds a good spice to the mild dishes. \\nGood lomo saltado according to bf.

So the coffee here is just as atrocious as at the other locations.... it is so bad. Normally I can drink a cup of coffee with only half a creamer, but here I put in two creamers and it still tasted terrible. I tried something new today and got the Cabo skillet. It has home fries with bell pepper, onion, jalapeno, cilantro, green chilis, new mexican chili, tomatoes, and scallions in it. Then they melt jalapeno jack cheese on top and put some slices of avocado on that AND it has two eggs on top which I ordered over medium. This thing was good. I mean super good! It was just the right amount of spicy, it did not need any salt and pepper (and I love salt and pepper on my eggs) and it did not need ketchup. It was pretty wonderful and huge, I couldn't eat it all. This is definitely the best thing I've ever had at chompies. Oh, so it comes with a bagel on the side, and mine was a little burnt.... but normally the bagels here are pretty good. The BF got biscuits and gravy and thought they were a bit too sweet, but I don't know about that because I don't like biscuits and gravy and didn't taste it. Our friends got a different skillet and an omelet of sorts, and both said it was really good.   Overall, this was a Chompie's win, especially in comparison to the last few times I've been and it wasn't so good. \\n\\nAlso, bring back the Lovie's difficult decision! That was the best thing ever!

Now keep in mind the sign's a bit misleading- the first thing that catches your eye says 'bento box.' Not Fresh Wasabi. But you know, I'm always down for Japanese food. The place had a decent amount of people in it, and perusing the menu I saw two things that immediately caught my eye- ramen and bulgogi. I love the former, my husband the latter. So why not? I order me some ramen, get him the bulgogi bowl, and get us a cali roll to enjoy as well. \\n\\nThe food came out promptly. That was... really about the only good thing here on out. \\n\\nMy biggest beef (no pun intended) was how they packaged my ramen. They kept the broth and the noodles in two separate Styrofoam bowls. Pretty standard procedure. But they they proceed to stack my noodles and broth, my husband's bulgogi bowl AND the cali roll one on top of the other in some precarious leaning tower of take out asian food. It was a disaster waiting to happen. But I totter out with this tower of food tied up in a plastic bag, and proceed to drive the 5 or so miles home as carefully as I could. \\n\\nNo luck. The thing topples over at the first light I gently pull to a stop at, and by the time I get home and bring the plastic bag in I realize that my broth is no longer in my styrofoam bowl, but all over the bottom of the plastic bag. \\n\\nThank god for good plastic bags. At least they invested in those, because the lids on the soup bowl sure weren't up to par. The weight of everything else on top of the broth bowl broke the lid, and the braking did the rest. Soup got into our cali rolls, but NOT my noodles. My husband's bulgogi bowl escaped largely unscathed, but that didn't save it. It was bland and not very much like bulgogi. The cali roll was also, even without being soggy, mediocre and bland. And the mayo in the krab-mayo mix was yellow. Why, oh why? \\n\\nNow I'll take credit where credit's due. I SHOULD have asked to repackage the stuff. But even without the soup disaster, which I did try to put aside, the food was bland, mediocre, and not very authentic. \\n\\nAll in all, a disaster.

No VIP entrance needed cause there was no line and go in and no reserved seated needed cause it was almost empty. And it said on all info packed sat nights get there early. Seated limited!

{"trgt": "This place was crazy. We thought at first that the staff must be a bunch of college students that just started working a week ago, but after reading the other reviews, I'm not sure this is true! I think one major issue is that there is team service and thus no one individual waiter was responsible for our table. \\n\\nThere was one waiter (blond, short) who seemed to be in charge. He spent most of our visit appearing baffled. I watched him at the register station trying to write up bills and use the register. Comical. It took 15 minutes for them to visit our table after we were seated. After that the food came out at a nice pace - first some appetizer type things, then the steamed dumpling appetizer we ordered, and our entrees. \\n\\nThe food was fine. I am not a Korean food connoisseur, so I can't really comment on how authentic or good it is - to our American palates, it was just ok. Also seemingly expensive, but the portions were large. \\n\\nOnce we were done eating, we started waiting. We waited, and waited and waited. The servers ignored us, and noodled around - they never actually look at the diners so it was super difficult to get anyone's attention. Finally we called a skinny waiter over, and asked for two simple things: 1) the check (which seemed to please him) and 2) take out boxes (which caused him to furrow his brow and look slightly angry). OK. \\n\\nSo this guy then continues doing random crap as if we had never asked for anything. 5-10 minutes go by while he walks back and forth to the kitchen, empty handed, and refilling water glasses (I must say, they were excellent with water service). It was as if we had never spoken to him. Finally we call the short blond waiter over and ask for 1) the check and 2) boxes. He says, oh, of course. He asks the skinny guy to get us boxes. Skinny guy rolls his eyes and says \\\"yeah, yeah, yeah\\\". Skinny guy proceeds to do other things for another 10 minutes before finally procuring two take out containers from the depths of Squirrel Hill. \\n\\nNow for the check. We waited and waited some more. Blond, short waiter looks confused but decides he needs something to do. He walks around asking how everyone's food is. He takes orders from other tables. Finally, we ask, can we *please* for the love of everything that is holy have our check? He replied incredulously, \\\"Oh! You haven't gotten your check yet?!?!?!?\\\" So if he didn't get our check, who would have gotten it? He is the check guy! OMG I didn't even know what to think. \\n\\nNeedless to say, we paid in cash to save the pain of waiting our credit card to be run. And then we ran out of the restaurant. Please go to the Green Pepper only if 1) You truly love Korean food or 2) You are writing an expose on baffled waiters.

{"trgt": "I really had great expectation for RM seafood with Rick Moonen being on Top Chef and being so passionate about his food but left with pure disappointment and here is why....\\n\\nAlthough I made reservation for lunch; when we got there, the restaurant was practically empty so we were seated right away. On the reservation, I stated we are celebrating our anniversary and hubby's birthday but the hostess didn't bother looking at the reservation and acknowledge our celebration like other restaurants did.\\n\\nAnyway...we didn't have breakfast so I did a quick glance of the menu and was ready to order. We ordered the crab cake $16), clam chowder ($9), lobster roll ($27) and the fish tacos ($17).\\n\\nThe crab cake just came by it self with some aioli sauce which I thought for $16 bucks, we should have gotten two. It was a medium size crab cake with chunks of crab but who puts pineapple in their crab cakes? I sure don't. I thought the crab cake was bland. I was hoping really bold flavors, at least with a slight kick.\\n\\nOn came the clam chowder which should have been called bacon chowder since their were more bacon bits than clams. The consistency was watery like soup rather than a chowder. The flavor certainly wasn't the taste of the oceanic clams, it was bacon and dairy (milk and creamy) and left that dairy after taste like I just had a cup of milk which I don't like.\\n\\nAfter the chowder, it seems like we were done because we waited for about 15 minutes and our entrees have not arrived yet. We waited patiently..mind you again, the restaurant wasn't busy..about only five tables were filled. The waiter finally comes over and asked if we received our entrees yet, and when we said no, he went to check and mentioned they messed up on the orders. At that point, hubby and I was already talking about canceling the rest of our orders and eating at Burger Bar. Unfortunately, when I asked if our orders were being made, hubby's fish was already on the fire so we left it at that but mine wasn't even made yet, so I was able to cancel it. Hubby's fish taco finally came and he enjoyed it but not worth $17.\\n\\nWhen the bill came, he forgot to take out the lobster roll, so he had to go correct it. Once the initial corrected bill arrived, I noticed there were extra charges thinking there was a sharing charge but it didn't make sense; so I informed the waiter...he realized he charged us the dinner prices! Then he tells us this is his third day...OH MY.....The Manager was there at all times in his fancy suit but never even came over to apologize or anything.\\n\\nI really don't mind paying more for good food, but paying so much for the quality and service I experienced here was just a letdown especially since it is known as an upscale restaurant.

The clubs we went to were absolutely amazing...\\n\\nEXCEPT Prive!\\n\\nSo let me just say, all the girls that work there were BITCHES! We ordered about 5 drinks and we wanted to pay with cash and card. The bartender said, \\\"Well, we can't do that!\\\" Hella snobby and rude. We were confused why she couldn't perform such an easy task... which EVERYWHERE else can! We were asking her why and she was just giving us attitude like \\\"WE JUST CAN'T.\\\" So we were sitting there trying to gather money together to pay for our drinks and she got impatient and randomly just picked up our drinks and slammed them to the side and said \\\"I can't deal with this! Either you pay, or you don't get your drinks!\\\" And we were so shocked... that's what we were trying to do, was PAY. DUH. It's not like we're just gonna walk away. I swear she was a dumb bitch. Sorry. I don't mean to be rude, but she was a total BUZZ KILL. And to kill a buzz in Vegas is a pretty huge accomplishment. So I guess the bitch gets one star for that... NOT. Anyways, my friend ends up putting in $40 for only his drink, because we all didn't have cash on us. (By the way, the drinks were ridicuously over priced!) Throughout this whole lame discussion with this bartender my friends and I were being totally calm and respectful.

However, the people who run this location are entirely incompetent. \\n\\nFirst problem: Since I already had a reservation, I was forced to use this extremely bizarre video chat system where I picked up what equaled a pay phone and video chatted with a representative. This was while there were available representatives on site. The manager who \\\"dialed\\\" the rep didn't explain the process at all.\\n\\nThe representative I spoke to was fine, but she misled me and tried to up-sell me twice and then completely lost interest in helping me when she realized she wasn't going to make her sales quota through me.

They just kind of pointed and said, \\\"It's near the fence.\\\" Um, the entire place is surrounded by a fence! \\n\\nThird problem: They gave us no inspection paperwork. We had to get in the car, drive around and ask for it and then inspect the car ourselves. They took the paperwork afterwards, but who knows what they did with it!\\n\\nFourth problem: We returned the car 1 hour late, which meant we incurred a $30 fee for a late return. I understand that this is the policy, but didn't know before hand. The manager said he could do nothing except give me a gift certificate. Tough luck for me since I already swore up and down that I would never rent from Hertz again.  I resolved to call when I returned home.\\n\\nFifth problem: I called and emailed customer service about my charge. WHen I finally got a hold of someone, they told me that there was nothing they could do since I already accepted the gift certificate, and because I accepted it, it meant that I agreed the issue was resolved.\\n\\nThat's when I was really incensed since no one ever said that by accepting the certificate that I agreed I was OK with being charged $30/hour. Because I most certainly was not! As a \\\"goodwill\\\" gesture, she reduced my fee by a whopping $15.38.\\n\\nConsider this your fair warning. If I could give this company zero stars, I would.

We walked into the restaurant where the manager very rudely and loud enough for other patrons to hear tell us we could not bring food from other \\\"restaurants\\\" into \\\"her\\\" restaurant. Her overreaction was completely unnecessary and very embarrassing to my family and me. Undeterred, we did stay even though we were forced to sit outside, not our first choice of seating arrangements. The wait staff was embarrassed by the actions the manager and they did a great job taking care of us. Perhaps a better way for the manager to handle the situation would have been to offer us a doggie bag or some way to conceal our \\\"contraband\\\" so we might have enjoyed indoor seating along with the other paying customers.

I also take off points whenever a place only has Sriracha and none of that \\\"home made\\\" style chili sauce. This isn't really a big deal.

{"trgt": "Now in general I've spends multiple weekends at Bellagio and loved it which is why I've come back time and time again.  This last trip with my girlfriends left a bad taste in my mouth.  2 things.  When I packed up and went home, I realized that I had left a dress of mine hanging in the closet. I called Bellagio's lost and found.  I told them my room number, where i had left it and what it looked like down to the size. They told me nothing was left in the room and there was nothing in lost and found that resembled the dress. Disappointed, i left it at that. What can i do, I am more than positive that was the only place it could have been because it is no longer in my possession and I remember hanging it in the close next to the tv. \\n\\nThen I get a call from my friend who stayed in the same room as myself, she told me the following.  On checkout, we had sometime before our flight back to los angeles.  We then check our bags into the baggage deposit for a couple of hours. In my friends duffle along with her clothes and shoes was a small purse resembling an camera case.  When she arrived back home to unpack, the small purse was gone. The purse had a bit of money in it. My friend then called the Bellagio as well. She spoke to the Valet manager. They did not find it (not a surprise) and was told that it happens alot.  It happens ALOT?! That is not an acceptable answer. It should never happen esp when we stay at a 5 star hotel. That why we pay a higher rate because we believe it would be an honest establishment with out fear of theft to our belongings.\\n\\nSo...pretty much I'm going to assume that my dress that i left hanging was taken(not put in lost and found) and my friend's purse that was hidden in her duffle was stolen purposely.

I'll start with the highlights.\\n\\n1) Our server was very nice.  Great personality and even gave some good recommendations for offstrip restaurants.\\n2) The Beef Filet was quite was good.  That and the Charcuterie plate were probably the two best items that we had.\\n3) The wine selection was quite good.  The Sommelier acted of high importance, but didn't show any action for his promises.  As shown below.\\n\\nThe bad:\\n1) The restaurant is in the Wynn, and prices were as expected.  They were not outrageous, but for the quality of the food, they seemed a bit high.\\n2) As we were eating the duck, the Sommelier asked how the duck was.  I told him that it was chewy and not very good.  At first he acted surprised, and said he would take it off the bill.  As the norm, I said, \\\"oh no, that's ok\\\" (still expecting him to do it).  He then replied, \\\"other people have said they didn't like either.  I'm taking it off for you guys.\\\"  I figured if he DID stand behind that comment, that would def. bump La Cave up a star.  If he didn't, then it goes down a star because it was that bad.\\n3) Other disappointing dishes were the overcooked and small Scallops, the watery grits, and the chewy lamb.\\n\\nLa Cave is a 3 star restaurant for the mediocre food, and above average service for the strip.  All dishes were \\\"OK\\\" and nothing blew any of us away.  It was all just OK.  As you guessed, the duck remained on the bill, and as expected, the Sommelier was just giving us words.

{"trgt": "I have very mixed feelings about the Mirage. Some things were great, others just OK, while some things sucked ass.\\n\\nFirst the good: The renovated rooms are very nice. Flat screen TV's plus all kinds of ports for computers, video games, and an Ipod dock. Lots of granite , very comfortable chairs, all around a tasteful, comfortable room.  Also the air-conditioning was quiet and very cool. The only complaints about the room were the cheap plastic toilet seat that wouldn't fucking stay up when I was urinating, and the shower/tub combo seemed claustrophobic and I couldn't help but get the entire floor wet when bathing. \\n\\nThe buffet was also very good, and laid out well, no bottlenecks of people standing holding their plates impatiently waiting for food (hear me Paris?) The asian items were my favorite along with huge cold crab legs. Japonais restaurant was excellent. Though expensive, the service was amazing and every single item was yummy.  \\n\\nI did have good luck in the casino on the slots, despite Mirage's reputation for having a tight casino.  I played ALIEN slots and won like $150 in a matter of seconds when I hit a bonus round and blew the alien out of the airlock.  I screamed out loud I was so happy.  I never ever win anything. That made my fucking day!!\\n\\nNow for what was bad:  Caribe Cafe--this place sucked big steaming brown loafs! The service was atrocious, the menu very limited and expensive, and the food was dog shit. All big strip casino's have a diner/coffee shop usually open 24hrs, but this place was awful in every way, even the coffee sucked!  Downscale, older places i have stayed at such the Imperial Palace, or Tropicana had better  coffee shops.  \\n\\nThere also seemed to be a lot of small technical problems which were frequent.  The card keys were stubborn and had to be inserted repeatedly EVERY SINGLE TIME I entered the room.  When I contacted the front desk they talked down to me like i had in IQ of ten.  Scripted, condescending answers and questions--\\\"Did you insert the card right? Make sure the strip is facing this way, etc. etc\\\" I also had problems with my MGM-Mirage players card having to get a new card TWICE within a four day visit. Each time the ignorant, inept employee gave me a totally different (wrong) explanation on why my card kept malfunctioning.  I hate it when places of business refuse to honestly answer questions and give scripted or made up bullshit answers.  The final demonstration of incompetence was on my final day in Vegas when I had a slot machine voucher I wanted to cash in.  The computers were down and it was impossible to cash in the voucher, even by going to a live teller instead of a machine.  Thankfully the voucher was only for $7.67 but still...\\n\\nThe only time the hotel incompetence worked in my favor was the mini bar in the room.  Me and my friends had some of the tiny liquor bottles in the mini bar and should have been been charged approximately $36.  Well, it's been over a month and no charge on my card!  Woohoo! I shoulda drank more;)\\n\\nSo, would I stay at the Mirage again? Probably not. Despite the reasonable rate of $77 a night and the nicely updated room and excellent location, there was just too much spotty service and general hotel incompetence to make me wanna risk it.", "beginning": "I have very mixed feelings about the Mirage.

The beach is awesome BUT you have to get in line 10-15 minutes before 9am to ensure you get a spot on the beach - for a hotel this size, the beach doesn't seem to be big enough to accommodate half the guests at any given time. Several heated conversations on the beach about chairs and what not. Luckily, we were there bright and early every day and got a spot! The beach has a small, fast food style cafe that serves sandwiches, chicken fingers, hot dogs, burgers and some breakfast foods. Also has a sit down grill type restaurant - nachos, burgers, chicken fingers all of which looked amazing but tasted awful :( stick with the chicken fingers - can't go wrong. The elevators were a problem, frequent LONG waits in lines to get up and down to and from the hotel room, that was beyond annoying! It felt like you had hit the jackpot on the rare occasion you didn't have to wait several minutes for an elevator.

First, let me clarify that I love my doctor, Dr. Bui. He is the ONLY reason why I still continue to go to this office. However, I try to avoid calling or making appointments as much as possible. I have been going to this office for over 15 years, but for the past year or so everything besides Dr. Bui is absolutely horrible. Words cannot describe how awful the front desk and office is. Without fail, every time I call the office for a need, the person on the other line is unbelievably rude. In addition, there is hardly a time when I get put on hold for less than 30 minuets, because no one knows what they're doing because. The reason I say that they don't know what they're doing is because the last time I called, while on hold, I had to tell them 3 separate times what the reason for my call was. They kept putting me back on hold and forgetting to transfer me then asking me why I was on hold again. Also, if I suddenly become sick and call to make an appointment to see a doctor as soon as possible, who ever answers the phone is almost excited and enjoys telling me that Dr. Bui is completely booked for appointments for at least a week in advanced.

{"trgt": "Some people are wildly creative and enjoy putting together their own costume creation. Thankfully, for the rest of us who have no such skill set, but a desire to look good in our costumed glory, there is Showoff Costume Rentals. \\n\\nThere are countless places that pop up around Halloween with packaged costumes that look like every other costume in the Valley. They carry the same exact outfits next to the same exact accessories wall. Have you wondered were you could go to find a truly unique looking costume for an event?  Years ago, I stumbled on Showoff and have returned to them anytime I have needed a costume for an event.  \\n\\nMAKING AN APPOINTMENT: You must call ahead and make an appointment to go in. This is an important step. The shop is small so the owner, Gillian, doesn't have all of the costumes out on the floor for you to peruse. Instead you will discuss your costume idea and set up a time to get into the shop. When you arrive Gillian and/or an employee will have a number of options already set aside for you to consider. There is no better costume customer service in this town. Try getting anything like that kind of service at the pop-up shops. You simply tell Gillian what you are leaning toward and she will consider your specific theme and your size and she pull out costume options that fit your needs. \\n\\nYOUR APPOINTMENT TIME: You will show up and try on the options that they have selected. Whenever I've been there the owner has given me personal service. She looks at the costume on you, see how it fits, discusses the accessories, and helps customize the entire look. Customers don't have to worry about hanging around for hours. If you're like me, you will fall in love with the first or second option that they select for you. And the employees are right there to ring you up. No lines. \\n\\nOPTIONS: Showoff specializes in showgirl costumes.  And their selection is thorough. These are not thrown together costumes. The showgirl costumes are elegant, larger than life, and most importantly, glamorous.  I believe they are very careful with those rentals, so if you are looking for a showgirl rental, you will need to communicate with the owner. From what I've seen of their selection, there isn't any place in town with better Vegas-themes costumes But there are a wealth of other costumes available for rental: Elvis, magician, elf, cartoon character, Cleopatra, you name it. One of the best things about the costumes is the amount and quality of the accessories they include with your look. Want to be a 1920's gangster? SOC will have the suit, the weapon, the bling, the hat, and any other details necessary to give more polish to your look.  They have been dressing showgirls and other entertainers in this town for years. They take great pride in matching the customer with a costume she/he will love. This place is not trying to shove a costume at you. They want you to leave looking and feeling good about your selection. \\n\\nCOST: The costumes aren't cheap.

They can easily eat enough food for a family of 6 all by themselves. Today, we walked out and vowed never to return because of the owners rude behavior. We love the wings and the happy hour specials and always support a family business over the big boys.

{"trgt": "Before I start, I must say that I'm Mexican and for the purpose of this review this does not mean anything else but: I'm proud of my food and I can be very strict with anything served as / associated with/ recognised as Mexican. Next, three facts:\\n\\n1. Burritos can be found in their natural habitat only in the north of Mexico. And not all the north, but only some states. It's a very simple snack: a flour tortilla with a bit of beans and cheese (the most traditional one). You can also find burritos with other fillings (generally two, being one either beans or cheese). That's all, no rice, no cream, no guacamole, no salsa, etc... \\n\\n2. Burritos are now a very popular fast-food snack in the US, possibly more popular in the south of the US where lots of Mexican immigrants live these days. Therefore, burritos are part of what is now known as tex-mex food. I've never tried a burrito in the US so I don't know how they are served but I presume this is where burritos took their now more popular looks and taste.\\n\\n3. Los Cardos does not intend to serve real Mexican food or Mexican real burritos. They got the idea from the Californian tex-mex burrito and offer a healthier alternative to take-away food at a reasonable price, and using fresh ingredients and good quality products. This is what the website says (go and check if you want).\\n\\nSo now I think it will be fair to say that...\\n\\nLos Cardos' \\\"interpretation\\\" and/or \\\"re-construction\\\" of burritos is a successful one and I think the success is the result of taking some common ingredients in Mexican food (beans, rice, salsa verde, coriander, cream, etc) with others not so common (like carnitas) and still leave room for the costumer's choice. Sounds like a winning formula, right? So basically, you choose the type of tortilla, the type of meat, the fillings, the salsas. How tasty your burrito will turn out to be, well... it's up to you.\\n\\nWhile I was observing how my burrito was prepared (a carnitas burrito) with all the fillings I chose (cheese, cream, beans, rice, coriander, the whole lot really) the guy explained to me about the quality of products and freshness. And yes, very fresh and well prepared. So, what they say they offer is what you'll get. By the way, very friendly staff.\\n\\nAs a take-away you're not expecting the premises to be memorable. And as I was not planning to eat my burrito there, I didn't really pay attention to where costumers could eat. I do remember very vaguely to see a couple of tables with costumers. \\n\\nI paid for my burrito a bit more than 5 pounds. A massive burrito. And I know it is a reasonable price for take-away food in the UK -and even more if good quality products are taken into account, but I still think it is rather pricy. Or perhaps I can't be objective enough (I can't help comparing prices of burritos in Mexico and they don't cost much at all... it's a snack!). Let's say that compared to other take-away snacks (kebabs, for instance), Los Cardos' burritos are probably within the price range.\\n\\nSo... Is this place good? I think it is. Is this good for Mexicans (especially the ones from the north)? Perhaps... it all depends how orthodox / flexible you are. Will I go back? If I'm in the area, quite possibly. \\n\\nBeing far from Mexico, not having \\\"my\\\" food here, has had many different interesting effects: I cook more, I've discovered markets and delis where I can find Mexican products (will write a review of Lupe Pintos soon!) but I have also learnt to appreciate other foods. To me, Los Cardos' burritos, as they say on their website, are purely inspiration. And as that, I take it... Yet, I was the most grateful Mexican when I first smelt the carnitas and a very subtle hint of orange transported me to a street market full of bright colours and music. Perhaps it was just an illusion or perhaps I was just... inspired.", "beginning": "Before I start, I must say that I'm Mexican and"}

We took the recommendation of the staff and ordered the extra meat (additional 5 ounces for $3) since were feeling extra carnivorous! The BBQ pork ribs came with five succulent ribs with the meat just waiting to fall off the bone.

I have never been treated this rudely anywhere but the fact that we spent that much money and they literally threw the birthday girl out the minute they closed is just really tacky and unprofessional.

If there weren't some tables or chairs on the sidewalk in front of it, I don't think we would have found the right place or door to enter. From outside it looks like a smoke shop or a convenience store. There are posters and all kinds of stuff on the windows, not something you would expect at a classier place or restaurant. Inside we were pleasantly surprised however. Place was nice and cozy and nice music. It was overall a nice atmosphere...more lounge like than restaurant like.

I was already full before my appetizer, soup and salad came out. My family waited to get soup and salad before touching their meals, but by that time their main course meal was already cold.

I'm not going to lie here, the drink was not good to me because it had a strong beer taste and I don't like beer. They use their Peach ale in that drink and it overpowers the other flavors including the bourbon. Don't get it if you don't like the taste of beer. My burger, which came out as I ordered it (medium well) was delivered really fast. I don't know how you make a medium well burger that fast. Anyway, It was not juicy, it was not bad, it was not great, it was edible. My friends liked their food. One of my friends ordered a quesadilla and she said it was good. My other friend ordered nachos and it was huge. She ate some and took the rest home.

Same room just a few floors higher. The T.V did not work and neither did the in room movie service. There excuse was there are thousands of rooms and they can not keep them all working all the time. Nothing was offered for that. At adult pool apparently all the front row chairs are reserved for cabanas. Which is fine but make sure they are marked. We had a cabana waitress come over and yell at my wife to move because we did not have a cabana. Not even a please just yelled at her to move. The chairs she was sitting in were not marked in any way. All they had to eat at the pool was pre packaged sandwiches and when you are allergic to certain things it makes it pointless. I was so taken back on this trip. Upon checkout and speaking to multiple people no one even cared. They got our money and they were done with us. It was our first Time staying there and we will not be going back. Should have stuck with the Bellagio which we are use to and will stay there from now on!! They had me fill out a comment card... Like I will ever hear anything back on that one what a joke.", "beginning": "For such a nice hotel you would think there customer"}
{"trgt": "Before I moved to the far east side of Madison, The Egg & I was my go to weekend morning breakfast joint. \\nI would sure like to know what brand of coffee they are serving, because it is absolutely delicious! \\nThey have ample serving sizes and tons of seating! Huge parking area!\\n\\nWhat I enjoy most about this restaurant is the fact that they are only open for breakfast and lunch. The quality of their food shows that they can put more effort into making a great breakfast vs. planning for the dinner menu later in the day. What a great concept!\\n\\nIf I had to suggest ordering one thing, it would be the green chili (as a side for dipping and spreading on eggs and potatoes). It's pretty fantastic! \\n\\nI also enjoy the fact that they have so many choices for other side orders and bread choices. Sour dough! My favorite!\\n\\nAs for the lunch menu, they have burgers, salads, and sandwiches. nothing too specials. Just great prices quality food. \\n\\nHonestly, I wish that they would expand and make a new Egg & I on the east side of Madison. You would find me eating there at least once a month.", "beginning": "Before I moved to the far east side of Madison,"}
{"trgt": "This place is horrible! Let me first say that I have gone to the babystacks on buffalo too many times to count and I love it. The food was always exceptional, as was the staff. I didn't like how cramped it was, however, so I was happy when they built this one. So let me tell you why I despise this location. The first time my fianc\\u00e9 and I went here he ordered a coffee that had been forgotten for a good 20 minutes so we had to request another and didn't receive so much as an apology. Then I ordered the Cinnabon pancakes, which I've had many times, without pecans because I am allergic. The waitress said oh okay no problem. Guess what came on top of my pancakes? Yep, you guessed it, pecans!! So that right there did not make me fall in love. BUT...I decided to give it another chance. We went again a few weeks later. I ordered the cookies and cream pancakes and made sure it didn't come with any nuts. I was assured it didn't. When my pancakes came out I saw a stray nut sitting on too of the pancakes...it wasn't exactly hidden folks. The waiter apologized and took them to get remade. Let me just let you know that I  am deathly allergic to all nuts; like throat closing, hospital going allergic. The manager came by to apologize and promise me that my pancakes were being remade and she would supervise. They finally come out after my fianc\\u00e9 was done with his meal. I start eating them, and they are pretty darn good, then I just decide to flip my pancake over and what do I see?!?! Another freaking nut on the bottom of the freaking pancake!!! Are you kidding me?! At this point I'm almost in tears. This is my life, like it's kind of serious. The waiter kind of laughed and took them away again. I'm sorry, is the possibility of me becoming seriously ill or even dying funny to you?! The manager gave me some bs and just kind of danced around it. I don't really know all I heard was wah wah wah. I wasn't just some disgruntled customer who didn't like something. This should have been taken a lot more serious than it was. Needless to say I will never set foot In this building again. Their pancakes are pretty freaking good, but not good enough to be my last meal!!", "beginning": "This place is horrible! Let me first say that I"}

The lobster mash was a little bland and cucumber martini I liked but it was weird and my co-worker took a sip and throught it was gross. I like weird things sometimes. Of course it was Vegas and overpriced but the scallops really were pretty perfect. However, you only get three and I am a big eater and left there kinda hungry.

{"trgt": "Met a guy named Kortnei on the strip and he told us the ladies could get in free and the guys would have to pay 20 but, there would be free drinks from 10-1130.  We arrived at 10, and were greeted with VIP passes and the ladies were escorted upstairs.  Myself and 4 other male buddies went down stairs with our VIP passes and were told to stand in the General Admission line.  When we showed our passes they laughed and told us we were in the right line, and we were NOT on the guest list!!  Then, we were told that the entry was $30, and we could not get in for 40-45 minutes.  (After the free drinks).  But, the bouncer offered to get us in with a \\\"Fast Pass\\\" for another $20, so it was $50 per person to get in.  We all left disgusted!  Not for the $50, to get in which we gladly would have paid because we were there to party.  It was just the bait and switch, SHADINESS that went down.  I gave 2 stars becuse the resort is nice and we salvaged our night at the Deuce Lounge.", "beginning": "Met a guy named Kortnei on the strip and he"}
