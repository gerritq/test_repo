Both variants\nare shown to attain near-optimal regret in the non-corrupted case $C = 0$,\nwhile incurring additional additive terms respectively having a linear and\nquadratic dependency on $C$ in general. We present algorithm independent lower\nbounds showing that these additive terms are near-optimal.

{"title": "Cosmology from supernova magnification maps", "trgt": "  High-z Type Ia supernovae are expected to be gravitationally lensed by the\nforeground distribution of large-scale structure. The resulting magnification\nof supernovae is statistically measurable, and the angular correlation of the\nmagnification pattern directly probes the integrated mass density along the\nline of sight. Measurements of cosmic magnification of supernovae therefore\ncomplements galaxy shear measurements in providing a direct measure of\nclustering of the dark matter. As the number of supernovae is typically much\nsmaller than the number of sheared galaxies, the two-point correlation function\nof lensed Type Ia supernovae suffers from significantly increased shot noise.\nNeverthless, we find that the magnification map of a large sample of\nsupernovae, such as that expected from next generation dedicated searches, will\nbe easily measurable and provide an important cosmological tool. For example, a\nsearch over 20 sq. deg. over five years leading to a sample of ~ 10,000\nsupernovae would measure the angular power spectrum of cosmic magnification\nwith a cumulative signal-to-noise ratio of ~20. This detection can be further\nimproved once the supernova distance measurements are cross-correlated with\nmeasurements of the foreground galaxy distribution. The magnification maps made\nusing supernovae can be used for important cross-checks with traditional\nlensing shear statistics obtained in the same fields, as well as help to\ncontrol systematics. We discuss two applications of supernova magnification\nmaps: the breaking of the mass-sheet degeneracy when estimating masses of\nshear-detected clusters, and constraining the second-order corrections to weak\nlensing observables.\n"}
{"title": "Opacity Driven Convection and Variability in Accretion Disks around\n  Supermassive Black Holes", "trgt": "  We study the structure of accretion disks around supermassive black holes in\nthe radial range $30\\sim 100$ gravitational radii, using a three dimensional\nradiation magneto-hydrodynamic simulation. For typical conditions in this\nregion of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), the Rosseland mean opacity is expected\nto be larger than the electron scattering value. We show that the iron opacity\nbump causes the disk to be convective unstable. Turbulence generated by\nconvection puffs up the disk due to additional turbulent pressure support and\nenhances the local angular momentum transport. This also results in strong\nfluctuations in surface density and heating of the disk. The opacity drops with\nincreasing temperature and convection is suppressed. The disk cools down and\nthe whole process repeats again. This causes strong oscillations of the disk\nscale height and luminosity variations by more than a factor of $\\approx 3-6$\nover a few years' timescale. Since the iron opacity bump will move to different\nlocations of the disk for black holes with different masses and accretion\nrates, we suggest that this is a physical mechanism that can explain the\nvariability of AGN with a wide range of amplitudes over a time scale of years\nto decades.\n"}
{"title": "Hardness of Peeling with Stashes", "trgt": "  The analysis of several algorithms and data structures can be framed as a\npeeling process on a random hypergraph: vertices with degree less than k and\ntheir adjacent edges are removed until no vertices of degree less than k are\nleft. Often the question is whether the remaining hypergraph, the k-core, is\nempty or not. In some settings, it may be possible to remove either vertices or\nedges from the hypergraph before peeling, at some cost. For example, in hashing\napplications where keys correspond to edges and buckets to vertices, one might\nuse an additional side data structure, commonly referred to as a stash, to\nseparately handle some keys in order to avoid collisions. The natural question\nin such cases is to find the minimum number of edges (or vertices) that need to\nbe stashed in order to realize an empty k-core. We show that both these\nproblems are NP-complete for all $k \\geq 2$ on graphs and regular hypergraphs,\nwith the sole exception being that the edge variant of stashing is solvable in\npolynomial time for $k = 2$ on standard (2-uniform) graphs.\n"}

From these fits, we derive light-weighted ages and metallicities, which\nagree with stellar wind and photospheric spectral features, and infer the\nspectral shapes and strengths of the ionizing continua. Inferred light-weighted\nstellar metallicities span 0.05-1.5 Z$_\\odot$ and are similar to the measured\nnebular metallicities. We quantify the ionizing continua using the ratio of the\nionizing flux at 900\\AA\\ to the non-ionizing flux at 1500\\AA\\ and demonstrate\nthe evolution of this ratio with stellar age and metallicity using theoretical\nsingle burst models. These single burst models only match the inferred ionizing\ncontinua of half of the sample, while the other half are described by a mixture\nof stellar ages. Mixed age populations produce stronger and harder ionizing\nspectra than continuous star formation histories, but, contrary to previous\nstudies that assume constant star formation, have similar stellar and nebular\nmetallicities. Stellar population age and metallicity affect the far-UV\ncontinua in different and distinguishable ways; assuming a constant star\nformation history diminishes the diagnostic power. Finally, we provide simple\nprescriptions to determine the ionizing photon production efficiency\n($\\xi_{ion}$) from the stellar population properties. $\\xi_{ion}$ has a range\nof log($\\xi_{ion})=24.4-25.7$ Hz erg$^{-1}$ that depends on stellar age,\nmetallicity, star formation history, and contributions from binary star\nevolution.

However, these methods that target PSNR\nmaximization usually produce blurred images at large upscaling factor. The\nintroduction of generative adversarial networks (GANs) can mitigate this issue\nand show impressive results with synthetic high-frequency textures.\nNevertheless, these GAN-based approaches always have a tendency to add fake\ntextures and even artifacts to make the SR image of visually higher-resolution.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel perceptual image super-resolution method that\nprogressively generates visually high-quality results by constructing a\nstage-wise network. Specifically, the first phase concentrates on minimizing\npixel-wise error, and the second stage utilizes the features extracted by the\nprevious stage to pursue results with better structural retention.

When two subclusters collide each other,\na bow shock is formed between the centers of two substructures and propagate in\nboth directions along the collision axis. The shock primarily heats the ions\nbecause the kinetic energy of an ion entering the shock is larger than that of\nan electron by the ratio of masses. In the post-shock region the energy is\ntransported from the ions to electrons via Coulomb coupling. However, since the\nenergy exchange timescale depends both on the gas density and temperature,\ndistribution of electron temperature becomes more complex than that of the\nplasma mean temperature, especially in the expanding phase. After the collision\nof two subclusters, gas outflow occurs not only along the collision axis but\nalso in its perpendicular direction. The gas which is originally located in the\ncentral part of the subclusters moves both in the parallel and perpendicular\ndirections.

Energetic electrons and protons have been observed\nover a remarkable large longitudinal range at the two STEREO spacecraft and\nSOHO suggesting a longitudinal spread of nearly 360 degrees at 1AU. The flaring\nactive region, which was on the backside of the Sun as seen from Earth, was\nseparated by more than 100 degrees in longitude from the magnetic footpoints of\neach of the three spacecraft. The event is characterized by strongly delayed\nenergetic particle onsets with respect to the flare and only small or no\nanisotropies in the intensity measurements at all three locations. The presence\nof a coronal shock is evidenced by the observation of a type II radio burst\nfrom the Earth and STEREO B. In order to describe the observations in terms of\nparticle transport in the interplanetary medium, including perpendicular\ndiffusion, a 1D model describing the propagation along a magnetic field line\n(model 1) (Dr\\\"oge, 2003) and the 3D propagation model (model 2) by (Dr\\\"oge et\nal., 2010) including perpendicular diffusion in the interplanetary medium have\nbeen applied, respectively. While both models are capable of reproducing the\nobservations, model 1 requires injection functions at the Sun of several hours.\nModel 2, which includes lateral transport in the solar wind, reveals high\nvalues for the ratio of perpendicular to parallel diffusion. Because we do not\nfind evidence for unusual long injection functions at the Sun we favor a\nscenario with strong perpendicular transport in the interplanetary medium as\nexplanation for the observations.\n"}

{"title": "Gas-grain chemistry in cold interstellar cloud cores with a microscopic\n  Monte Carlo approach to surface chemistry", "trgt": "  AIM: We have recently developed a microscopic Monte Carlo approach to study\nsurface chemistry on interstellar grains and the morphology of ice mantles. The\nmethod is designed to eliminate the problems inherent in the rate-equation\nformalism to surface chemistry. Here we report the first use of this method in\na chemical model of cold interstellar cloud cores that includes both gas-phase\nand surface chemistry. The surface chemical network consists of a small number\nof diffusive reactions that can produce molecular oxygen, water, carbon\ndioxide, formaldehyde, methanol and assorted radicals. METHOD: The simulation\nis started by running a gas-phase model including accretion onto grains but no\nsurface chemistry or evaporation. The starting surface consists of either flat\nor rough olivine. We introduce the surface chemistry of the three species H, O\nand CO in an iterative manner using our stochastic technique. Under the\nconditions of the simulation, only atomic hydrogen can evaporate to a\nsignificant extent. Although it has little effect on other gas-phase species,\nthe evaporation of atomic hydrogen changes its gas-phase abundance, which in\nturn changes the flux of atomic hydrogen onto grains. The effect on the surface\nchemistry is treated until convergence occurs. We neglect all non-thermal\ndesorptive processes. RESULTS: We determine the mantle abundances of assorted\nmolecules as a function of time through 2x10^5 yr. Our method also allows\ndetermination of the abundance of each molecule in specific monolayers. The\nmantle results can be compared with observations of water, carbon dioxide,\ncarbon monoxide, and methanol ices in the sources W33A and Elias 16. Other than\na slight underproduction of mantle CO, our results are in very good agreement\nwith observations.\n"}

The\ndisc was modeled to have the density and temperature of a minimum mass solar\nnebula, and was driven to a fully-developed turbulence via the\nmagnetorotational instability (MRI). We find that the inclusion of standard\ndust to gas ratios does not have any significant effect on the MRI even when\nthe dust sediments to the midplane of the accretion disc. The density\ndistribution of the dust reaches a Gaussian profile, and the scale heights for\nthe dust that we derive are shown to be proportional to the reciprocal of the\nsquare root of the dust radius. The largest dust shows a strong tendency to\nsettle to the midplane of the accretion disc, and tends to organize itself into\nelongated clumps of high density. The dynamics of these clumps is shown to be\nconsistent with a streaming instability. The streaming instability is seen to\nbe very vigorous and persistent once it forms. Each stream of high density dust\ndisplays a reduced RMS velocity dispersion, and the densest clumpings of large\ndust are shown to form where the streams intersect. We have also shown that the\nmean free path and collision time for the dust that participates in the\nstreaming instability is reduced by almost two orders of magnitude relative to\nthe average mean free paths and collision times. We show that some of the large\ndust in our 10 au simulations should have a propensity for grain coalescence.\n"}

The generalized suffix tree of two\nstrings $A$ and $B$ is a compacted trie representing all suffixes in $A$ and\n$B$.

Our suffix tree for an\nalignment of $A$ and $B$ has $|A| + l_d + l_1$ leaves where $l_d$ is the sum of\nthe lengths of all parts of $B$ different from $A$ and $l_1$ is the sum of the\nlengths of some common parts of $A$ and $B$.

Spectroscopic confirmation for the whole\nsample is obtained within 1-3 orbits based on the presence of strong spectral\nbreaks and Balmer absorption lines. Combining their spectra with optical to\nnear-IR photometry, star-forming solutions are formally rejected for the entire\nsample. Broad spectral indices are consistent with the presence of young A-type\nstars, which implies that the last major episode of star formation has taken\nplace no earlier than $\\sim$300-800 Myr prior to observation. Marginalising\nover three different slopes of the dust attenuation curve, we obtain short\nmass-weighted ages and an average peak star formation rate of SFR$\\sim10^3$\nM$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ at $z_{formation}\\sim3.5$. Despite mid- and far-IR data\nare too shallow to determine the obscured SFR on a galaxy-by-galaxy basis, the\nmean stack emission from 3GHz data constrains the level of residual obscured\nSFR to be globally below 50 M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, hence three times below the\nscatter of the coeval main sequence.

The problem is that turbulent velocities are convolved with the density\nof an observed region. To correct for this convolution, we investigate the\nrelation between the turbulence spectrum of model clouds, and the statistics of\ntheir synthetic observations obtained from Principal Component Analysis (PCA).\nWe apply PCA to spectral maps generated from simulated density and velocity\nfields, obtained from hydrodynamic simulations of supersonic turbulence, and\nfrom fractional Brownian motion fields with varying velocity, density spectra,\nand density dispersion. We examine the dependence of the slope of the PCA\nstructure function, alpha_PCA, on intermittency, on the turbulence velocity\n(beta_v) and density (beta_n) spectral indexes, and on density dispersion. We\nfind that PCA is insensitive to beta_n and to the log-density dispersion\nsigma_s, provided sigma_s < 2. For sigma_s>2, alpha_PCA increases with sigma_s\ndue to the intermittent sampling of the velocity field by the density field.\nThe PCA calibration also depends on intermittency. We derive a PCA calibration\nbased on fBms with sigma_s<2 and apply it to 367 CO spectral maps of molecular\nclouds in the Galactic Ring Survey. The average slope of the PCA structure\nfunction, <alpha_PCA>=0.62\\pm0.2, is consistent with the hydrodynamic\nsimulations and leads to a turbulence velocity exponent <beta_v>=2.06\\pm0.6 for\na non-intermittent, low density dispersion flow.

This makes SMR a good fit for workloads dominated by large data\nobjects with limited churn. To explore this possibility, we have developed\nSMORE, an object storage system designed to reliably and efficiently store\nlarge, seldom-changing data objects on an array of host-managed or host-aware\nSMR disks.\n  SMORE uses a log-structured approach to accommodate the constraint that all\nwrites to an SMR drive must be sequential within large shingled zones. It\nstripes data across zones on separate disks, using erasure coding to protect\nagainst drive failure. A separate garbage collection thread reclaims space by\nmigrating live data out of the emptiest zones so that they can be trimmed and\nreused. An index stored on flash and backed up to the SMR drives maps object\nidentifiers to on-disk locations. SMORE interleaves log records with object\ndata within SMR zones to enable index recovery after a system crash (or failure\nof the flash device) without any additional logging mechanism.\n  SMORE achieves full disk bandwidth when ingesting data---with a variety of\nobject sizes---and when reading large objects. Read performance declines for\nsmaller object sizes where inter- object seek time dominates. With a worst-case\npattern of random deletions, SMORE has a write amplification (not counting RAID\nparity) of less than 2.0 at 80% occupancy. By taking an index snapshot every\ntwo hours, SMORE recovers from crashes in less than a minute. More frequent\nsnapshots allow faster recovery.\n"}

Our objective is to minimize the\ncomputation error by jointly optimizing the transmit power at the\npower-constrained devices and a signal scaling factor (called denoising factor)\nat the fusion center (FC). The problem is generally non-convex due to the\ncoupling of the transmit power over devices and denoising factor at the FC. To\ntackle the challenge, we first consider the special case with static channels,\nfor which we derive the optimal solution in closed form. The optimal power\ncontrol exhibits a threshold-based structure. Specifically, for each device, if\nthe product of the channel quality and power budget, called quality indicator,\nexceeds an optimized threshold, this device applies channel-inversion power\ncontrol; otherwise, it performs full power transmission. Building on the\nresults, we proceed to consider the general case with time-varying channels.

The derived\noptimal power control exhibits a regularized channel inversion structure, where\nthe regularization has the function of balancing the tradeoff between the\nsignal-magnitude alignment and noise suppression. Moreover, for the special\ncase with only one device being power limited, we show that the optimal power\ncontrol for the power-limited device has an interesting channel-inversion\nwater-filling structure, while those for other devices (with sufficient power\nbudgets) reduce to channel-inversion power control over all fading states.\n"}

{"title": "Few-Shot Segmentation via Cycle-Consistent Transformer", "trgt": "  Few-shot segmentation aims to train a segmentation model that can fast adapt\nto novel classes with few exemplars. The conventional training paradigm is to\nlearn to make predictions on query images conditioned on the features from\nsupport images. Previous methods only utilized the semantic-level prototypes of\nsupport images as conditional information. These methods cannot utilize all\npixel-wise support information for the query predictions, which is however\ncritical for the segmentation task. In this paper, we focus on utilizing\npixel-wise relationships between support and query images to facilitate the\nfew-shot segmentation task. We design a novel Cycle-Consistent TRansformer\n(CyCTR) module to aggregate pixel-wise support features into query ones. CyCTR\nperforms cross-attention between features from different images, i.e. support\nand query images. We observe that there may exist unexpected irrelevant\npixel-level support features. Directly performing cross-attention may aggregate\nthese features from support to query and bias the query features.

In this work, we\npresent a meta-imitation learning method that enables a robot to learn how to\nlearn more efficiently, allowing it to acquire new skills from just a single\ndemonstration. Unlike prior methods for one-shot imitation, our method can\nscale to raw pixel inputs and requires data from significantly fewer prior\ntasks for effective learning of new skills. Our experiments on both simulated\nand real robot platforms demonstrate the ability to learn new tasks,\nend-to-end, from a single visual demonstration.\n"}
{"title": "Reliable Damping of Free Surface Waves in Numerical Simulations", "trgt": "  This paper generalizes existing approaches for free-surface wave damping via\nmomentum sinks for flow simulations based on the Navier-Stokes equations. It is\nshown in 2D flow simulations that, to obtain reliable wave damping, the\ncoefficients in the damping functions must be adjusted to the wave parameters.\nA scaling law for selecting these damping coefficients is presented, which\nenables similarity of the damping in model- and full-scale. The influence of\nthe thickness of the damping layer, the wave steepness, the mesh fineness and\nthe choice of the damping coefficients are examined. An efficient approach for\nestimating the optimal damping setup is presented. Results of 3D ship\nresistance computations show that the scaling laws apply to such simulations as\nwell, so the damping coefficients should be adjusted for every simulation to\nensure convergence of the solution in both model and full scale. Finally,\npractical recommendations for the setup of reliable damping in flow simulations\nwith regular and irregular free surface waves are given.\n"}

{"title": "Human brain distinctiveness based on EEG spectral coherence connectivity", "trgt": "  The use of EEG biometrics, for the purpose of automatic people recognition,\nhas received increasing attention in the recent years. Most of current analysis\nrely on the extraction of features characterizing the activity of single brain\nregions, like power-spectrum estimates, thus neglecting possible temporal\ndependencies between the generated EEG signals. However, important\nphysiological information can be extracted from the way different brain regions\nare functionally coupled. In this study, we propose a novel approach that fuses\nspectral coherencebased connectivity between different brain regions as a\npossibly viable biometric feature. The proposed approach is tested on a large\ndataset of subjects (N=108) during eyes-closed (EC) and eyes-open (EO) resting\nstate conditions. The obtained recognition performances show that using brain\nconnectivity leads to higher distinctiveness with respect to power-spectrum\nmeasurements, in both the experimental conditions. Notably, a 100% recognition\naccuracy is obtained in EC and EO when integrating functional connectivity\nbetween regions in the frontal lobe, while a lower 97.41% is obtained in EC\n(96.26% in EO) when fusing power spectrum information from centro-parietal\nregions. Taken together, these results suggest that functional connectivity\npatterns represent effective features for improving EEG-based biometric\nsystems.\n"}

The reconstruction\nstrategy of the online offline computing upgrade foresees a first synchronous\nonline reconstruction stage during data taking enabling detector calibration,\nand a posterior calibrated asynchronous reconstruction stage. We present a\ntracking algorithm for the Time Projection Chamber (TPC), the main tracking\ndetector of ALICE. The reconstruction must yield results comparable to current\noffline reconstruction and meet the time constraints like in the current High\nLevel Trigger (HLT), processing 50 times as many collisions per second as\ntoday. It is derived from the current online tracking in the HLT, which is\nbased on a Cellular automaton and the Kalman filter, and we integrate missing\nfeatures from offline tracking for improved resolution. The continuous TPC\nreadout and overlapping collisions pose new challenges: conversion to spatial\ncoordinates and the application of time- and location dependent calibration\nmust happen in between of track seeding and track fitting while the TPC\noccupancy increases five-fold. The huge data volume requires a data reduction\nfactor of 20, which imposes additional requirements: the momentum range must be\nextended to identify low-pt looping tracks and a special refit in uncalibrated\ncoordinates improves the track model entropy encoding. Our TPC track finding\nleverages the potential of hardware accelerators via the OpenCL and CUDA APIs\nin a shared source code for CPUs, GPUs, and both reconstruction stages.

Social\ntipping processes have been suggested as key drivers of sustainability\ntransitions emerging in the fields of technological and energy systems,\npolitical mobilization, financial markets and sociocultural norms and\nbehaviors.\n  Drawing from expert elicitation and comprehensive literature review, we\ndevelop a framework to identify and characterize social tipping processes\ncritical to facilitating rapid social transformations.

Prior works on self-testing require the assumption that the system's\nstate is shared among multiple parties that only perform local measurements and\ncannot communicate. Here, we replace the setting of multiple non-communicating\nparties, which is difficult to enforce in practice, by a single computationally\nbounded party. Specifically, we construct a protocol that allows a classical\nverifier to robustly certify that a single computationally bounded quantum\ndevice must have prepared a Bell pair and performed single-qubit measurements\non it, up to a change of basis applied to both the device's state and\nmeasurements. This means that under computational assumptions, the verifier is\nable to certify the presence of entanglement, a property usually closely\nassociated with two separated subsystems, inside a single quantum device.

{"title": "Diffusing wave spectroscopy: a unified treatment on temporal sampling\n  and speckle ensemble methods", "trgt": "  Diffusing wave spectroscopy (DWS) is a well-known set of methods to measure\nthe temporal dynamics of dynamic samples. In DWS, dynamic samples scatter the\nincident coherent light, and the information of the temporal dynamics is\nencoded in the scattered light. To record and analyze the light signal, there\nexist two types of methods - temporal sampling methods and speckle ensemble\nmethods. Temporal sampling methods, including diffuse correlation spectroscopy\n(DCS), use one or multiple large bandwidth detectors to well sample and analyze\nthe temporal light signal to infer the sample temporal dynamics. Speckle\nensemble methods, including speckle visibility spectroscopy (SVS), use a\nhigh-pixel-count camera sensor to capture a speckle pattern and use the speckle\ncontrast to infer sample temporal dynamics. In this paper, we theoretically and\nexperimentally demonstrate that the decorrelation time ({\\tau}) measurement\naccuracy or SNR of the two types of methods has a unified and similar\nfundamental expression based on the number of independent observables (NIO) and\nthe photon flux. Given a time measurement duration, NIO in temporal sampling\nmethods is constrained by the measurement duration, while speckle ensemble\nmethods can outperform by using simultaneous sampling channels to scale up NIO\nsignificantly. In the case of optical brain monitoring, the interplay of these\nfactors favors speckle ensemble methods. We illustrate that this important\nengineering consideration is consistent with the previous research on blood\npulsatile flow measurements, where a speckle ensemble method operating at\n100-fold lower photon flux than a conventional temporal sampling system can\nachieve a comparable SNR.\n"}

In this paper, we\nreport studies on the resilience or robustness of this modular structure: under\nsystematic erosion of connectivity in the network under thresholding, how\nresilient is the modularity and hub structure? The results show that the\nnetwork shows show strong resilience properties, with the modularity and hub\nstructure maintaining itself over a large range of connection strengths.

However, it has been proved that conventional\ncarrier phase recovery (CPR) algorithm designed for uniform distribution may\nhave extra penalty in PS systems.

To solve\nthis issue, a modified QPSK partition algorithm that jointly optimizes the\namplitude decision threshold and filter weight is proposed, where the\noptimization of decision threshold is based on maximum a posterior probability\n(MAP) estimation. Different from the conventional decision methods which\ncommonly use Euclidean distance metric, the MAP-based decision introduces the\nstatistical characteristics of the received signals to obtain an accurate\namplitude partition. In addition, the filter weight is optimized for different\ndecision thresholds to enhance the tolerance of ASE-induced phase noise.

To solve this problem, we propose an automatic image quality\nassessment scheme based on multi-task learning to assist in FS image quality\ncontrol. An essential criterion for FS image quality control is that all the\nessential anatomical structures in the section should appear full and\nremarkable with a clear boundary. Therefore, our scheme aims to identify those\nessential anatomical structures to judge whether an FS image is the standard\nimage, which is achieved by three convolutional neural networks. The Feature\nExtraction Network aims to extract deep level features of FS images. Based on\nthe extracted features, the Class Prediction Network determines whether the\nstructure meets the standard and Region Proposal Network identifies its\nposition. The scheme has been applied to three types of fetal sections, which\nare the head, abdominal, and heart. The experimental results show that our\nmethod can make a quality assessment of an FS image within less a second.

They are taken at juxtaposed frequencies. The\nreference image of the region is called Ground Truth map (GT). the problematic\nis how to find the good bands to classify the pixels of regions; because the\nbands can be not only redundant, but a source of confusion, and decreasing so\nthe accuracy of classification. Some methods use Mutual Information (MI) and\nthreshold, to select relevant bands. Recently there's an algorithm selection\nbased on mutual information, using bandwidth rejection and a threshold to\ncontrol and eliminate redundancy. The band top ranking the MI is selected, and\nif its neighbors have sensibly the same MI with the GT, they will be considered\nredundant and so discarded. This is the most inconvenient of this method,\nbecause this avoids the advantage of hyperspectral images: some precious\ninformation can be discarded. In this paper we'll make difference between\nuseful and useless redundancy. A band contains useful redundancy if it\ncontributes to decreasing error probability. According to this scheme, we\nintroduce new algorithm using also mutual information, but it retains only the\nbands minimizing the error probability of classification. To control\nredundancy, we introduce a complementary threshold. So the good band candidate\nmust contribute to decrease the last error probability augmented by the\nthreshold.

The low dissipation makes these transmission lines suitable for a number\nof applications that are microwave and millimeter-wave band analogues of\nnonlinear optical processes. As an example, by applying a millimeter-wave pump\ntone, very wide band parametric amplification was observed between about 3 and\n34 GHz. Use as a current variable delay line for an on-chip millimeter-wave\nFourier transform spectrometer is also considered.\n"}

Contrary to the classical beta\ntransformation, the density of the absolutely continuous invariant measure of\nthe negative beta transformation may be zero on certain intervals. By\ninvestigating this property in detail, we prove that the\n$(-\\beta)$-transformation is exact for all $\\beta>1$, confirming a conjecture\nof G\\'ora, and intrinsic, which completes a study of Faller. We also show that\nthe limit behaviour of the $(-\\beta)$-expansion of 1 when $\\beta$ tends to 1 is\nrelated to the Thue-Morse sequence. A consequence of the exactness is that\nevery Yrrap number, which is a $\\beta>1$ such that the $(-\\beta)$-expansion of\n1 is eventually periodic, is a Perron number. This extends a well-known\nproperty of Parry numbers. However, the set of Parry numbers is different from\nthe set of Yrrap numbers.\n"}
{"title": "SMAP: Simultaneous Mapping and Planning on Occupancy Grids", "trgt": "  Occupancy grids are the most common framework when it comes to creating a map\nof the environment using a robot. This paper studies occupancy grids from the\nmotion planning perspective and proposes a mapping method that provides richer\ndata (map) for the purpose of planning and collision avoidance. Typically, in\noccupancy grid mapping, each cell contains a single number representing the\nprobability of cell being occupied. This leads to conflicts in the map, and\nmore importantly inconsistency between the map error and reported confidence\nvalues. Such inconsistencies pose challenges for the planner that relies on the\ngenerated map for planning motions. In this work, we store a richer data at\neach voxel including an accurate estimate of the variance of occupancy. We show\nthat in addition to achieving maps that are often more accurate than tradition\nmethods, the proposed filtering scheme demonstrates a much higher level of\nconsistency between its error and its reported confidence. This allows the\nplanner to reason about acquisition of the future sensory information. Such\nplanning can lead to active perception maneuvers that while guiding the robot\ntoward the goal aims at increasing the confidence in parts of the map that are\nrelevant to accomplishing the task.\n"}

{"title": "Online Multicast Traffic Engineering for Software-Defined Networks", "trgt": "  Previous research on SDN traffic engineering mostly focuses on static\ntraffic, whereas dynamic traffic, though more practical, has drawn much less\nattention. Especially, online SDN multicast that supports IETF dynamic group\nmembership (i.e., any user can join or leave at any time) has not been\nexplored. Different from traditional shortest-path trees (SPT) and graph\ntheoretical Steiner trees (ST), which concentrate on routing one tree at any\ninstant, online SDN multicast traffic engineering is more challenging because\nit needs to support dynamic group membership and optimize a sequence of\ncorrelated trees without the knowledge of future join and leave, whereas the\nscalability of SDN due to limited TCAM is also crucial. In this paper,\ntherefore, we formulate a new optimization problem, named Online Branch-aware\nSteiner Tree (OBST), to jointly consider the bandwidth consumption, SDN\nmulticast scalability, and rerouting overhead. We prove that OBST is NP-hard\nand does not have a $|D_{max}|^{1-\\epsilon}$-competitive algorithm for any\n$\\epsilon >0$, where $|D_{max}|$ is the largest group size at any time. We\ndesign a $|D_{max}|$-competitive algorithm equipped with the notion of the\nbudget, the deposit, and Reference Tree to achieve the tightest bound.

It is well-known for its relativistic baryonic jets, but the system\nalso drives equatorial outflows.

We wish to spatially resolve the regions\nproducing the stationary emission lines of SS 433 to shed light on its\ncircumbinary structure and outflows. With an estimated binary orbit size\n$\\lesssim 0.1 \\text{ mas}$, this requires optical interferometry. We use the\noptical interferometer VLTI+GRAVITY to spatially resolve SS 433 in the\nnear-infrared K band at high spectral resolution ($R\\approx 4000$) on three\nnights in July 2017. The stationary Br$\\gamma$ line is clearly dominated by an\nextended $\\sim 1 \\text{ mas} \\sim 5 \\text{ AU}$ circumbinary structure\nperpendicular to the jets and with a strong rotation component. The rotation\ndirection is retrograde relative to the jet precession, in accordance with the\nslaved disk precession model. The structure has a very high specific angular\nmomentum and is too extended to be a stable circumbinary disk in Keplerian\nrotation; interpreting it as such leads to a very high enclosed mass $M \\gtrsim\n400 M_{\\odot}$. We instead interpret it as the centrifugal ejection of the\ncircumbinary disk, with the implication that there must be an efficient\ntransfer of specific angular momentum from the binary to the disk. We suggest\nthat the equatorial outflows sometimes seen in radio images result from similar\nepisodes of circumbinary disk centrifugal ejection.

The method is based on the direct solution of the\nBoltzmann equation via an extension of the Lattice Boltzmann (LB) equation and\nallows to model the evolution of the radiation field as it interacts with a\nbackground fluid, via absorption, emission, and scattering. As a first\napplication of this method, we restrict our attention to a frequency\nindependent (\"grey\") formulation within a special-relativistic framework, which\ncan be employed also for classical computational astrophysics. For a number of\nstandard tests that consider the performance of the method in optically thin,\noptically thick and intermediate regimes with a static fluid, we show the\nability of the LB method to produce accurate and convergent results matching\nthe analytic solutions. We also contrast the LB method with commonly employed\nmoment-based schemes for the solution of the RTE, such as the M1 scheme. In\nthis way, we are able to highlight that the LB method provides the correct\nsolution for both non-trivial free-streaming scenarios and the intermediate\noptical-depth regime, for which the M1 method either fails or provides\ninaccurate solutions. When coupling to a dynamical fluid, on the other hand, we\npresent the first self-consistent solution of the RTE with LB methods within a\nrelativistic-hydrodynamic scenario. Finally, we show that besides providing\nmore accurate results in all regimes, the LB method features smaller or\ncomparable computational costs compared to the M1 scheme.\n"}

The spatio-temporal\nstructure of the surface deformation is analyzed by the optical method Free\nSurface Synthetic Schlieren, which allows for time-resolved measurements with a\nmicrometric accuracy. Because of the high viscosity of the liquid, the flow\ninduced by the turbulent wind in the liquid remains laminar, with weak surface\ndrift velocity. Two regimes of deformation of the liquid-air interface are\nidentified.

The amplitude of these\ndeformations increases approximately linearly with wind velocity and are\nessentially independent of the fetch (distance along the channel).

{"title": "Curing the unphysical behaviour of NLO quarkonium production at the LHC\n  and its relevance to constrain the gluon PDF at low scales", "trgt": "  We address the unphysical energy dependence of quarkonium-hadroproduction\ncross sections at Next-to-Leading Order (NLO) in alpha_S which we attribute to\nan over-subtraction in the factorisation of the collinear singularities inside\nthe PDFs in the MSbar scheme. Such over- or under-subtractions have a limited\nphenomenological relevance in most of the scattering processes in particle\nphysics. On the contrary, it is particularly harmful for P_T-integrated\ncharmonium hadroproduction which renders a wide class of NLO results\nessentially unusable. Indeed, in such processes, alphaS is not so small, the\nPDFs are not evolved much and can be rather flat for the corresponding momentum\nfractions and, finally, some process-dependent NLO pieces are either too small\nor too large. We propose a scale-fixing criterion which avoids such an\nover-subtraction. We demonstrate its efficiency for eta(c,b) but also for a\nfictitious light elementary scalar boson. Having provided stable NLO\npredictions for eta(c,b) P_T-integrated cross sections, sigma^NLO(eta(Q)), and\ndiscussed the options to study eta(b) hadroproduction, we argue that their\nmeasurement at the LHC can help better determine the gluon PDF at low scales\nand tell whether the local minimum in conventional NLO gluon PDFs around\nx=0.001 at scales below 2 GeV is physical or not.\n"}
{"title": "Radial mixing in the outer Milky Way disk caused by an orbiting\n  satellite", "trgt": "  Using test particle simulations we examine the structure of the outer\nGalactic disk as it is perturbed by a satellite in a tight eccentric orbit\nabout the Galaxy.

We examine particle eccentricity versus the change in\nmean radius between initial and current orbits. Correlations between these\nquantities are reduced after a few satellite pericenter passages. Stars born in\nthe outer galaxy can be moved in radius from their birth positions and be\nplaced in low eccentricity orbits inside their birth radii.

{"title": "Cumulative link models for deep ordinal classification", "trgt": "  This paper proposes a deep convolutional neural network model for ordinal\nregression by considering a family of probabilistic ordinal link functions in\nthe output layer. The link functions are those used for cumulative link models,\nwhich are traditional statistical linear models based on projecting each\npattern into a 1-dimensional space. A set of ordered thresholds splits this\nspace into the different classes of the problem. In our case, the projections\nare estimated by a non-linear deep neural network. To further improve the\nresults, we combine these ordinal models with a loss function that takes into\naccount the distance between the categories, based on the weighted Kappa index.\nThree different link functions are studied in the experimental study, and the\nresults are contrasted with statistical analysis. The experiments run over two\ndifferent ordinal classification problems and the statistical tests confirm\nthat these models improve the results of a nominal model and outperform other\nrobust proposals considered in the literature.\n"}
{"title": "An Accelerated DFO Algorithm for Finite-sum Convex Functions", "trgt": "  Derivative-free optimization (DFO) has recently gained a lot of momentum in\nmachine learning, spawning interest in the community to design faster methods\nfor problems where gradients are not accessible.

Algorithms\nthat use acceleration in such a setting are prone to instabilities, making it\ndifficult to reach convergence. In this work, we exploit the finite-sum\nstructure of the objective in order to design a variance-reduced DFO algorithm\nthat provably yields acceleration. We prove rates of convergence for both\nsmooth convex and strongly-convex finite-sum objective functions. Finally, we\nvalidate our theoretical results empirically on several tasks and datasets.\n"}

{"title": "Ice Model Calibration Using Semi-continuous Spatial Data", "trgt": "  Rapid changes in Earth's cryosphere caused by human activity can lead to\nsignificant environmental impacts. Computer models provide a useful tool for\nunderstanding the behavior and projecting the future of Arctic and Antarctic\nice sheets. However, these models are typically subject to large parametric\nuncertainties due to poorly constrained model input parameters that govern the\nbehavior of simulated ice sheets. Computer model calibration provides a formal\nstatistical framework to infer parameters using observational data, and to\nquantify the uncertainty in projections due to the uncertainty in these\nparameters. Calibration of ice sheet models is often challenging because the\nrelevant model output and observational data take the form of semi-continuous\nspatial data, with a point mass at zero and a right-skewed continuous\ndistribution for positive values. Current calibration approaches cannot handle\nsuch data.

The light curves show that the\nvariability amplitudes in $\\gamma$-ray and optical bands are larger than those\nin the hard X-ray and radio bands and that the spectral energy distribution\n(SED) peaks move to shorter wavelengths when the source becomes brighter, which\nare similar to other blazars, i.e., more variable at wavelengths shorter than\nthe SED peak frequencies. Analysis shows that the characteristic variability\ntimescales in the 14.5 GHz, the optical, the X-ray, and the $\\gamma$-ray bands\nare comparable to each other. The variations of the hard X-ray and 14.5 GHz\nemissions are correlated with zero-lag, so are the V band and $\\gamma$-ray\nvariations, which are consistent with the leptonic models.

We\nmodel disk systems having gas masses of 10^8 and 10^9 solar masses with\nsupernova rates of 30, 300, and 3000 per Myr. The supernova events are confined\nto the midplane of the disk, but distributed over radii of 0, 30, and 80% of\nthe disk radius, consistent with expectations for Type II supernovae. In\nagreement with earlier studies, we find that the enriched material from\nsupernovae is largely lost when the supernovae are concentrated near the\nnucleus, as expected for a starburst event. In contrast, however, we find the\nloss of enriched material to be much less efficient when the supernovae occur\nover even a relatively small fraction of the disk. The difference is due to the\nability of the system to relax following supernova events that occur over more\nextended regions. Larger physical separations also reduce the likelihood of\nsupernovae going off within low-density \"chimneys\" swept out by previous\nsupernovae. We also find that, for the most distributed systems, significant\nmetal loss is more likely to be accompanied by significant mass loss. A\ncomparison with theoretical predications indicates that, when undergoing\nself-regulated star formation, galaxies in the mass range considered shall\nefficiently retain the products of Type II supernovae.\n"}

Although there is a rich literature in the\nfield of distributed systems security concerning secure multi-party\ncomputation, in practice it is hard to deploy those methods in very large scale\nPeer-to-Peer networks. In this work, we try to bridge the gap between\ntheoretical algorithms in the security domain, and a practical Peer-to-Peer\ndeployment.\n  We consider two security models. The first is the semi-honest model where\npeers correctly follow the protocol, but try to reveal private information. We\nprovide three possible schemes for secure multi-party numerical computation for\nthis model and identify a single light-weight scheme which outperforms the\nothers. Using extensive simulation results over real Internet topologies, we\ndemonstrate that our scheme is scalable to very large networks, with up to\nmillions of nodes. The second model we consider is the malicious peers model,\nwhere peers can behave arbitrarily, deliberately trying to affect the results\nof the computation as well as compromising the privacy of other peers. For this\nmodel we provide a fourth scheme to defend the execution of the computation\nagainst the malicious peers. The proposed scheme has a higher complexity\nrelative to the semi-honest model. Overall, we provide the Peer-to-Peer network\ndesigner a set of tools to choose from, based on the desired level of security.\n"}

The details of the transform depend on the waveforms\nunderlying the analysis, which in turn are specified through the implicit\nassumption that the signal is governed by a certain evolution equation. For\nexample, water waves generated by the Korteweg-de Vries equation can be\nexpressed in terms of cnoidal waves. Light waves in optical fiber governed by\nthe nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation (NSE) are another example. Nonlinear\nanalogs of classic problems such as spectral analysis and filtering arise in\nmany applications, with information transmission in optical fiber, as proposed\nby Yousefi and Kschischang, being a very recent one.

The study is motivated by fundamental questions in\ncomplex systems' response to significant environmental changes and by potential\napplications in investment strategies, including detecting triangular arbitrage\nopportunities. Dominant multiscale cross-correlations between the exchange\nrates are found to typically occur at smaller fluctuation levels. However\nhierarchical organization of ties expressed in terms of dendrograms, with a\nnovel application of the multiscale cross-correlation coefficient, are more\npronounced at large fluctuations.

The\ntheory is applied to thin films and also thick films to address new questions\nfor three different polymers of different dynamic fragility. Variation of the\nvitrification time scale criterion over many orders of magnitude is found to\nhave a minor effect on changes of the film-averaged Tg relative to its bulk\nvalue. The mobile layer length scale grows strongly with cooling and correlates\nin a nearly linear manner with the effective barrier deduced from the\ncorresponding bulk isotropic liquid alpha relaxation time.

This raises the\nquestion: how can neural networks with vastly more weights than training data\nstill generalise? A simple resolution to this conundrum is that the number of\nweights is usually a bad proxy for the actual amount of information stored.

An exception are quantum spin-liquids, where fluctuations prevent a\ntransition to an ordered state down to the lowest temperatures. While such\nstates are possibly realized in two-dimensional organic compounds, they have\nremained elusive in experimentally relevant microscopic two-dimensional models.\nHere, we show by means of large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations of\ncorrelated fermions on the honeycomb lattice, a structure realized in graphene,\nthat a quantum spin-liquid emerges between the state described by massless\nDirac fermions and an antiferromagnetically ordered Mott insulator. This\nunexpected quantum-disordered state is found to be a short-range resonating\nvalence bond liquid, akin to the one proposed for high temperature\nsuperconductors. Therefore, the possibility of unconventional superconductivity\nthrough doping arises. We foresee its realization with ultra-cold atoms or with\nhoneycomb lattices made with group IV elements.\n"}

We inverted Stokes IV spectropolarimetry\ninto magnetic field and surface brightness maps using a tomographic inversion\ncode that models high signal-to-noise ratio mean line profiles produced by the\nleast squares deconvolution (LSD) technique. The magnetic field and surface\nbrightness maps reveal similar patterns to previous DI and ZDI studies:\nnon-axisymmetric polar magnetic field structure, void of fields at\nmid-latitudes, and a complex structure in the equatorial regions. There is a\nweak but clear tendency of the polar structures to be linked with strong radial\nfield and the equatorial ones with the azimuthal. We find a polarity reversal\nin the radial field between 2016 and 2017 coincident with an activity minimum\nseen in the long-term photometry. The inverted field strengths cannot easily be\nrelated with the observed spottedness, but we find that they are partially\nconnected with the retrieved field complexity.

Missing samples can be compensated for by applying\nconventional missing data restoration methods; however, ensuring that restored\nsamples roughly follow underlying distributions of true missing data remains a\nchallenge. Another strategy involves directly restoring the probability density\nfunction (PDF) for a sensor when samples are missing by leveraging distribution\ninformation from another sensor with complete data using distribution\nregression techniques; existing methods include the conventional\ndistribution-to-distribution regression (DDR) and distribution-to-warping\nfunction regression (DWR) methods. Due to constraints on PDFs and warping\nfunctions, the regression functions of both methods are estimated from the\nNadaraya-Watson kernel estimator with relatively low degrees of precision. This\narticle proposes a new indirect distribution-to-distribution regression method\nin the context of functional data analysis for restoring distributions of\nmissing SHM data. PDFs are transformed to ordinary functions residing in a\nHilbert space via the newly proposed log-quantile-density (LQD) transformation;\nthe regression for distributions is realized in the transformed space via a\nfunctional regression model constructed based on the theory of Reproducing\nKernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), corresponding result is subsequently mapped back\nto the density space through the inverse LQD transformation. Test results using\nfield monitoring data indicate that the new method significantly outperforms\nconventional methods in general cases; however, in extrapolation cases, the new\nmethod is inferior to the distribution-to-warping function regression method.\n"}

The constrained\nHartree-Fock-Bogoliubov approximation is used to compute deformed mean-field\nconfigurations, zero-point quantum corrections and collective inertias. It is\nshown that a cumbersome full variational search of the least action fission\npath, within the space of HFB states, might not be required if the relevant\ndegrees of freedom are taken into account in the minimization of the\nWentzel-Kramers-Brillouin action.

A common recipe to perform such\nstudies is to push a large population of marker particles along their equations\nof motion, the trajectories randomized with Monte Carlo operators accounting\nfor Coulomb collisions, and to record possible intersections of the marker\ntrajectories with synthetic detectors or areas of interest in the first wall.\nWhile straightforward to implement and easy to parallelize, this Forward Monte\nCarlo (FMC) approach tends to suffer from poor statistics and error estimation\nas the detector domain is often small: it is difficult to guess how to set up\nthe initial weights and locations of the markers for them to remain\nrepresentative of the source distribution, yet record enough hits to the\ndetector for good statistics.

Endowing\nthe DM particles with non-negligible velocities causes free-streaming, which\nsuppresses the primordial power spectrum on small scales. The choice of a\nroot-mean-square velocity dispersion v(rms) = 0.05 km/s at redshift z=0\n(corresponding to a particle mass of 1 keV if the WDM particles are fermions\ndecoupling while relativistic) helps alleviate most, but probably not all, of\nthe small-scale problems faced by CDM. An important side-effect of the particle\nvelocities is the severe decrease in the number of collapsed halos at high\nredshift. This is caused both by the loss of small-scale power, and by the\ndelay in the collapse of the smallest individual halos (with masses near the\neffective Jeans mass of the DM). The presence of early halos is required in\norder (1) to host either early quasars or galaxies that can reionize the\nuniverse by redshift z=5.8, and (2) to allow the growth of the supermassive\nblack hole believed to power the recently discovered quasar SDSS 1044-1215 at\nthis redshift.

The noise characteristics of the combined light curves were verified by\ncomparing Allan variance plots of the residuals. The combined light curves for\neach system, along with radial velocity measurements from the literature when\navailable, were modeled using a Monte Carlo method to obtain the essential\nparameters that characterize the systems.

Here, we describe the relative, coordinated role of wet,\nmixed, and dry major mergers in driving this assembly. Accordingly to\nobservations, the model predicts that: 1) wet major mergers have controlled the\nmETGs buildup since z~1, although dry and mixed mergers have also contributed\nsignificantly to it; 2) the bulk of this assembly takes place during the ~1.4\nGyr time-period elapsed at 0.7<z<1, being nearly frozen at z<~0.7; 3) this\nfrostbite can be explained just accounting for the observational decrease of\nthe major merger fraction since z~0.7, implying that major mergers (and, in\nparticular, dry events) have contributed negligibly to the mETGs assembly\nduring the last ~6.3 Gyr; and 4) major mergers are responsible for doubling the\nstellar mass at the massive-end of the red sequence since z~1. The most\nstriking model prediction is that at least ~87% of the mETGs existing at z~1\nare not the passively-evolved, high-z counterparts of present-day mETGs, but\ntheir gas-poor progenitors instead. This implies that <~5% of present-day mETGs\nhave been really in place since z~1.

{"title": "ADMM-MCP Framework for Sparse Recovery with Global Convergence", "trgt": "  In compressed sensing, the l0-norm minimization of sparse signal\nreconstruction is NP-hard. Recent work shows that compared with the best convex\nrelaxation (l1-norm), nonconvex penalties can better approximate the l0-norm\nand can reconstruct the signal based on fewer observations. In this paper, the\noriginal problem is relaxed by using minimax concave penalty (MCP). Then\nalternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and modified iterative hard\nthresholding method are used to solve the problem. Under certain reasonable\nassumptions, the global convergence of the proposed method is proved. The\nparameter setting is also discussed. Finally, through simulations and\ncomparisons with several state-of-the-art algorithms, the effectiveness of\nproposed method is confirmed.\n"}
{"title": "Quantum Fluctuations and the Unruh Effect in Strongly-Coupled Conformal\n  Field Theories", "trgt": "  Through the AdS/CFT correspondence, we study a uniformly accelerated quark in\nthe vacuum of strongly-coupled conformal field theories in various dimensions,\nand determine the resulting stochastic fluctuations of the quark trajectory.\nFrom the perspective of an inertial observer, these are quantum fluctuations\ninduced by the gluonic radiation emitted by the accelerated quark. From the\npoint of view of the quark itself, they originate from the thermal medium\npredicted by the Unruh effect. We scrutinize the relation between these two\ndescriptions in the gravity side of the correspondence, and show in particular\nthat upon transforming the conformal field theory from Rindler space to the\nopen Einstein universe, the acceleration horizon disappears from the boundary\ntheory but is preserved in the bulk. This transformation allows us to directly\nconnect our calculation of radiation-induced fluctuations in vacuum with the\nanalysis by de Boer et al. of the Brownian motion of a quark that is on average\nstatic within a thermal medium. Combining this same bulk transformation with\nprevious results of Emparan, we are also able to compute the stress-energy\ntensor of the Unruh thermal medium.\n"}

Numerous strategies have been taken in order to prevent\nthe outbreak. Some countries took severe resections in the form of full-scale\nlockdown, while others took a moderate approach of dealing with the pandemics,\nfor example, mass testing, prohibiting large-scale public gatherings,\nrestricting international travels. South America adopted primarily the lockdown\nstrategies due to inadequate economy and health care support. Since the social\ninteractions between the people are primarily affected by the lockdown,\npsychological distress, e.g. anxiety, stress, fear are supposedly affecting the\nSouth American population in a severe way. This paper aims to explore the\nimpact of lockdown over the psychological aspect of the people of all the\nSpanish speaking South American capitals. We have utilized infodemiology\napproach by employing large-scale Twitter data-set over 33 million feeds in\norder to understand people's interaction over the months of this on-going\ncoronavirus pandemic. Our result is surprising: at the beginning of the\npandemic, people demonstrated strong emotions (i.e. anxiety, worry, fear) which\ndeclined over time even though the actual pandemic is worsening by having more\npositive cases, and inflicting more deaths. This leads us to speculate that the\nSouth American population is adapting to this pandemic thus improving the\noverall psychological distress.\n"}

{"title": "Formalising the multidimensional nature of social networks", "trgt": "  Individuals interact with conspecifics in a number of behavioural contexts or\ndimensions. Here, we formalise this by considering a social network between n\nindividuals interacting in b behavioural dimensions as a nxnxb multidimensional\nobject. In addition, we propose that the topology of this object is driven by\nindividual needs to reduce uncertainty about the outcomes of interactions in\none or more dimension. The proposal grounds social network dynamics and\nevolution in individual selection processes and allows us to define the\nuncertainty of the social network as the joint entropy of its constituent\ninteraction networks. In support of these propositions we use simulations and\nnatural 'knock-outs' in a free-ranging baboon troop to show (i) that such an\nobject can display a small-world state and (ii) that, as predicted, changes in\ninteractions after social perturbations lead to a more certain social network,\nin which the outcomes of interactions are easier for members to predict. This\nnew formalisation of social networks provides a framework within which to\npredict network dynamics and evolution under the assumption that it is driven\nby individuals seeking to reduce the uncertainty of their social environment.\n"}

However, the number\nof illuminating events as well as their ages and durations are still unresolved\nquestions. We aim to reconstruct parts of the history of Sgr A* by studying\nthis reflection phenomenon in the molecular complex Sgr C and by determining\nthe line-of-sight positions of its main bright substructures. Using\nobservations made with XMM-Newton and Chandra between 2000 and 2014, we\ninvestigated the variability of the reflected emission. We carried out an\nimaging and a spectral analysis. We also used a Monte Carlo model of the\nreflected spectra to constrain the line-of-sight positions of the brightest\nclumps, and hence to assign an approximate date to the associated illuminating\nevents. We show that the emission from Sgr C exhibits significant variability\nin both space and time, which confirms its reflection origin. The most likely\nilluminating source is Sgr A*. We report two distinct variability timescales,\nas one clump undergoes a sudden rise and fall in about 2005, while two others\nvary smoothly throughout the whole 2000-2014 period. By fitting the Monte Carlo\nmodel to the data, we are able to place tight constraints on the 3D positions\nof the clumps. These two independent approaches provide a consistent picture of\nthe past activity of Sgr A*, since the two slowly varying clumps are located on\nthe same wavefront, while the rapidly varying clump corresponds to a different\nwavefront, that is, to a different illuminating event. We show that Sgr A*\nexperienced at least two powerful outbursts in the past 300 years, and for the\nfirst time, we provide an estimation of their age. Extending this approach to\nother molecular complexes will allow this scenario to be tested further.\n"}

{"title": "The quenching of star formation in accretion-driven clumpy turbulent\n  tori of active galactic nuclei", "trgt": "  Galactic gas-gas collisions involving a turbulent multiphase ISM share common\nISM properties: dense extraplanar gas visible in CO, large linewidths (>= 50\nkm/s), strong mid-infrared H_2 line emission, low star formation activity, and\nstrong radio continuum emission. Gas-gas collisions can occur in the form of\nICM ram pressure stripping, galaxy head-on collisions, compression of the\nintragroup gas and/or galaxy ISM by an intruder galaxy which flies through the\ngalaxy group at a high velocity, or external gas accretion on an existing gas\ntorus in a galactic center. We suggest that the common theme of all these\ngas-gas interactions is adiabatic compression of the ISM leading to an increase\nof the turbulent velocity dispersion of the gas. The turbulent gas clouds are\nthen overpressured and star formation is quenched. Within this scenario we\ndeveloped a model for turbulent clumpy gas disks where the energy to drive\nturbulence is supplied by external infall or the gain of potential energy by\nradial gas accretion within the disk. The cloud size is determined by the size\nof a C-type shock propagating in dense molecular clouds with a low ionization\nfraction at a given velocity dispersion. We give expressions for the expected\nvolume and area filling factors, mass, density, column density, and velocity\ndispersion of the clouds. The latter is based on scaling relations of\nintermittent turbulence whose open parameters are estimated for the CND in the\nGalactic Center. The properties of the model gas clouds and the external mass\naccretion rate necessary for the quenching of the star formation rate due to\nadiabatic compression are consistent with those derived from high-resolution\nH_2 line observations. Based on these findings, a scenario for the evolution of\ngas tori in galactic centers is proposed and the implications for star\nformation in the Galactic Center are discussed.\n"}

The lack of standardized benchmark datasets makes\nit difficult to fully evaluate the capabilities of a metric and fairly compare\ndifferent metrics. Therefore, we propose OpenMEVA, a benchmark for evaluating\nopen-ended story generation metrics. OpenMEVA provides a comprehensive test\nsuite to assess the capabilities of metrics, including (a) the correlation with\nhuman judgments, (b) the generalization to different model outputs and\ndatasets, (c) the ability to judge story coherence, and (d) the robustness to\nperturbations. To this end, OpenMEVA includes both manually annotated stories\nand auto-constructed test examples. We evaluate existing metrics on OpenMEVA\nand observe that they have poor correlation with human judgments, fail to\nrecognize discourse-level incoherence, and lack inferential knowledge (e.g.,\ncausal order between events), the generalization ability and robustness. Our\nstudy presents insights for developing NLG models and metrics in further\nresearch.\n"}

{"title": "Poisson Denoising on the Sphere: Application to the Fermi Gamma Ray\n  Space Telescope", "trgt": "  The Large Area Telescope (LAT), the main instrument of the Fermi Gamma-Ray\nSpace Telescope, detects high energy gamma rays with energies from 20 MeV to\nmore than 300 GeV. The two main scientific ob jectives, the study of the Milky\nWay diffuse background and the detection of point sources, are complicated by\nthe lack of photons. That is why we need a powerful Poisson noise removal\nmethod on the sphere which is efficient on low count Poisson data. This paper\npresents a new multiscale decomposition on the sphere for data with Poisson\nnoise, called Multi-Scale Variance Stabilizing Transform on the Sphere\n(MS-VSTS). This method is based on a Variance Stabilizing Transform (VST), a\ntransform which aims to stabilize a Poisson data set such that each stabilized\nsample has a quasi constant variance. In addition, for the VST used in the\nmethod, the transformed data are asymptotically Gaussian. MS-VSTS consists of\ndecomposing the data into a sparse multi-scale dictionary like wavelets or\ncurvelets, and then applying a VST on the coefficients in order to get almost\nGaussian stabilized coefficients. In this work, we use the Isotropic\nUndecimated Wavelet Transform (IUWT) and the Curvelet Transform as spherical\nmulti-scale transforms. Then, binary hypothesis testing is carried out to\ndetect significant coefficients, and the denoised image is reconstructed with\nan iterative algorithm based on Hybrid Steepest Descent (HSD). To detect point\nsources, we have to extract the Galactic diffuse background: an extension of\nthe method to background separation is then proposed. In contrary, to study the\nMilky Way diffuse background, we remove point sources with a binary mask. The\ngaps have to be interpolated: an extension to inpainting is then proposed. The\nmethod, applied on simulated Fermi LAT data, proves to be adaptive, fast and\neasy to implement.\n"}

SD was only recently documented in humans and is\nnow considered a therapeutic target for brain injury, but the mechanisms\nrelated to SD in complex brains are not well understood. While there are\nnumerous approaches to interventional imaging of SD on the exposed brain\nsurface, measuring SD deep in brain is so far only possible with low\nspatiotemporal resolution and poor contrast. Here, we show that photoacoustic\nimaging enables the study of SD and its hemodynamics deep in the gyrencephalic\nbrain with high spatiotemporal resolution. As rapid neuronal depolarization\ncauses tissue hypoxia, we achieve this by continuously estimating blood\noxygenation with an intraoperative hybrid photoacoustic and ultrasonic (PAUS)\nimaging system. Due to its high resolution, promising imaging depth and high\ncontrast, this novel approach to SD imaging can yield new insights into SD and\nthereby lead to advances in stroke, and brain injury research.\n"}

Bonding and surface topography were\nmeasured with STM during the annealing process. Mn forms flat islands on the Ge\n{105} facet, whose shape and position is guided by the rebonded step\nreconstruction.

However,\nwhat the EC grid-codes actually compute to afford generalization remains\nelusive. We introduce two non-exclusive ideas regarding what grid-codes may\nrepresent to afford higher-level cognition. One idea is that grid-codes are\neigenvectors of the successor representation (SR) learned online during a task.\nThis view assumes that the grid codes serve as an efficient basis function for\nlearning and representing experienced relationships between entities.\nSubsequently, the grid codes facilitate generalization in novel contexts such\nas when the goal changes. The second idea is that the grid-codes reflect the\ninferred global task structure. This view assumes that the grid-code represents\na structural code that is factorized from specific sensory content, enabling\nstructural information to be transferred across tasks. Subsequently, the brain\ncould afford one-shot inferences without requiring experience. The ability to\ngeneralize experiences and make appropriate decisions in novel situations is\ncritical for both animals and machines. Here we review proposed computations of\nthe grid-code in the brain, which is potentially critical to behavioral\nflexibility.\n"}
{"title": "Sub-Eddington Star-Forming Regions are Super-Eddington: Momentum Driven\n  Outflows from Supersonic Turbulence", "trgt": "  We show that the turbulent gas in the star-forming regions of galaxies is\nunstable to wind formation via momentum deposition by radiation pressure or\nother momentum sources like supernova explosions, even if the system is below\nthe average Eddington limit. This conclusion follows from the fact that the\ncritical momentum injection rate per unit mass for unbinding gas from a\nself-gravitating system is proportional to the gas surface density and that a\nturbulent medium presents a broad distribution of column densities to the\nsources. For an average Eddington ratio of <Gamma>~0.1 and for turbulent Mach\nnumbers >30, we find that ~1% of the gas is ejected per dynamical timescale at\nvelocities larger than the local escape velocity. Because of the lognormal\nshape of the surface density distribution, the mass loss rate is highly\nsensitive to the average Eddington ratio, reaching 20-40% of the gas mass per\ndynamical time for <Gamma>=1. Using this model we find a large scatter in the\nmass-loading factor for star-forming galaxies, ranging from 0.001-10, but with\nsignificant uncertainties. Implications for the efficiency of star formation in\ngiant molecular clouds are highlighted. For radiation pressure feedback alone,\nwe find an increasing star formation efficiency as a function of initial gas\nsurface density. Uncertainties are discussed.\n"}

Upon surface functionalization with a metal\nporphyrin derivate, the decay is markedly slower and involves the\ndisproportionation of lead to Pb0 and Pb3+. In both cases, the decomposition is\npreceded by a contraction of the atomic lattice, which appears to initiate the\ndecay. We find that the metal porphyrin derivative induces a strong surface\ndipole on the nanocrystals, which we hold responsible for the altered and\nslower decomposition pathway. These results are important for application of\nlead halide perovskite nanocrystals in X-ray scintillators.\n"}

The phase diagrams in coordinates\ntemperature - film thickness were calculated for different epitaxial misfit\nstrains. Tensile misfit strains stimulate appearance of the spontaneous\nout-of-plane structural order parameter (displacement vector of an appropriate\noxygen atom from its cubic position) in the structural phase. Compressive\nmisfit strains stimulate appearance of the spontaneous in-plane structural\norder parameter. Gradients of the structural order parameter components, which\ninevitably exist in the vicinity of film surfaces due to the termination and\nsymmetry breaking, induce improper polarization and pyroelectric response via\nthe flexoelectric and rotostriction coupling mechanism. Flexoelectric and\nrotostriction coupling results in the roto-flexoelectric field that is\nantisymmetric inside the film, small in the central part of the film, where the\ngradients of the structural parameter are small, and maximal near the surfaces,\nwhere the gradients of the structural parameter are highest. The field induces\nimproper polarization and pyroelectric response. Penetration depths of the\nimproper phases (both polar and structural) can reach several nm from the film\nsurfaces. An improper pyroelectric response of thin films is high enough to be\nregistered with planar-type electrode configurations by conventional\npyroelectric methods.\n"}

{"title": "The ABC of Higher-Spin AdS/CFT", "trgt": "  In recent literature one-loop tests of the higher-spin AdS$_{d+1}$/CFT$_d$\ncorrespondences were carried out. Here we extend these results to a more\ngeneral set of theories in $d>2$. First, we consider the Type B higher spin\ntheories, which have been conjectured to be dual to CFTs consisting of the\nsinglet sector of $N$ free fermion fields. In addition to the case of $N$ Dirac\nfermions, we carefully study the projections to Weyl, Majorana, symplectic, and\nMajorana-Weyl fermions in the dimensions where they exist. Second, we explore\ntheories involving elements of both Type A and Type B theories, which we call\nType AB. Their spectrum includes fields of every half-integer spin, and they\nare expected to be related to the $U(N)/O(N)$ singlet sector of the CFT of $N$\nfree complex/real scalar and fermionic fields. Finally, we explore the Type C\ntheories, which have been conjectured to be dual to the CFTs of $p$-form gauge\nfields, where $p=\\frac d 2 -1$. In most cases we find that the free energies at\n$O(N^0)$ either vanish or give contributions proportional to the free-energy of\na single free field in the conjectured dual CFT.

{"title": "A Note On the Use of Fiducial Limits for Control Charts", "trgt": "  Many of the early works in the quality control literature construct control\nlimits through the use of graphs and tables as described in Wortham and Ringer\n(1972). However, the methods used in this literature are restricted to using\nonly the values that the graphs and tables can provide and to the case where\nthe parameters of the underlying distribution are known. In this note, we\nbriefly describe a technique which can be used to calculate exact control\nlimits without the use of graphs or tables. We also describe what are commonly\nreferred to in the literature as fiducial limits.

{"title": "Protein connectivity in chemotaxis receptor complexes", "trgt": "  The chemotaxis sensory system allows bacteria such as Escherichia coli to\nswim towards nutrients and away from repellents. The underlying pathway is\nremarkably sensitive in detecting chemical gradients over a wide range of\nambient concentrations. Interactions among receptors, which are predominantly\nclustered at the cell poles, are crucial to this sensitivity. Although it has\nbeen suggested that the kinase CheA and the adapter protein CheW are integral\nfor receptor connectivity, the exact coupling mechanism remains unclear. Here,\nwe present a statistical-mechanics approach to model the receptor linkage\nmechanism itself, building on nanodisc and electron cryotomography experiments.\nSpecifically, we investigate how the sensing behavior of mixed receptor\nclusters is affected by variations in the expression levels of CheA and CheW at\na constant receptor density in the membrane. Our model compares favorably with\ndose-response curves from in vivo F\\\"orster resonance energy transfer (FRET)\nmeasurements, demonstrating that the receptor-methylation level has only minor\neffects on receptor cooperativity. Importantly, our model provides an\nexplanation for the non-intuitive conclusion that the receptor cooperativity\ndecreases with increasing levels of CheA, a core signaling protein associated\nwith the receptors, whereas the receptor cooperativity increases with\nincreasing levels of CheW, a key adapter protein. Finally, we propose an\nevolutionary advantage as explanation for the recently suggested CheW-only\nlinker structures.\n"}
{"title": "Experiments on Density-Constrained Graph Clustering", "trgt": "  Clustering a graph means identifying internally dense subgraphs which are\nonly sparsely interconnected. Formalizations of this notion lead to measures\nthat quantify the quality of a clustering and to algorithms that actually find\nclusterings.

In this work we conduct a\ncomprehensive experimental evaluation of the qualitative behavior of greedy\nbottom-up heuristics driven by cut-based objectives and constrained by\nintracluster density, using both real-world data and artificial instances. Our\nstudy documents that a greedy strategy based on local movement is superior to\none based on merging. We further reveal that the former approach generally\noutperforms alternative setups and reference algorithms from the literature in\nterms of its own objective, while a modularity-based algorithm competes\nsurprisingly well. Finally, we exhibit which combinations of cut-based inter-\nand intracluster measures are suitable for identifying a hidden reference\nclustering in synthetic random graphs.\n"}

This allows the definition of a local ensemble of similarly\nconstructed universes, using only modest extrapolations of the observed\nbehavior of the cosmos. We then assume that further out in spacetime, similar\nuniverses can be constructed but containing different standard model\nparameters. Within this multiverse ensemble, it is assumed that the standard\nmodel parameters are strongly correlated with size, i.e. with the value of the\ninverse Hubble parameter at the final time, in a manner as previously\nsuggested. This allows an estimate of the range of sizes which allow life as we\nknow it, and invites a speculation regarding the most natural distribution of\nsizes. If small sizes are favored, this in turn allows some understanding of\nthe hierarchy problems of particle physics. Subsequent sections of the paper\nexplore other possible implications.

{"title": "Ordering of Trotterization: Impact on Errors in Quantum Simulation of\n  Electronic Structure", "trgt": "  Trotter-Suzuki decompositions are frequently used in the quantum simulation\nof quantum chemistry. They transform the evolution operator into a form\nimplementable on a quantum device, while incurring an error---the Trotter\nerror. The Trotter error can be made arbitrarily small by increasing the\nTrotter number. However, this increases the length of the quantum circuits\nrequired, which may be impractical. It is therefore desirable to find methods\nof reducing the Trotter error through alternate means. The Trotter error is\ndependent on the order in which individual term unitaries are applied. Due to\nthe factorial growth in the number of possible orderings with respect to the\nnumber of terms, finding an optimal strategy for ordering Trotter sequences is\ndifficult. In this paper, we propose three ordering strategies, and assess\ntheir impact on the Trotter error incurred. Initially, we exhaustively examine\nthe possible orderings for molecular hydrogen in a STO-3G basis. We demonstrate\nhow the optimal ordering scheme depends on the compatibility graph of the\nHamiltonian, and show how it varies with increasing bond length. We then use 44\nmolecular Hamiltonians to evaluate two strategies based on coloring their\nincompatibility graphs, while considering the properties of the obtained\ncolorings. We find that the Trotter error for most systems involving heavy\natoms, using a reference magnitude ordering, is less than 1 kcal/mol. Relative\nto this, the difference between ordering schemes can be substantial, being\napproximately on the order of millihartrees. The coloring-based ordering\nschemes are reasonably promising, however further work is required. Finally, we\nconsider ordering strategies based on the norm of the Trotter error operator,\nincluding an iterative method for generating the new error operator terms added\nupon insertion of a term into an ordered Hamiltonian.\n"}

The\nproposed scheme employs a cell-centered representation of the primary fluid\nvariables (including magnetic field) and conserves mass, momentum, magnetic\ninduction and energy.

The equivalence was established by Sokolov in the\ncontext of proving that the equivalence holds for models that satisfy cluster\nseparability. The generalized Bakamjian Thomas construction is used in most\napplications, even though it only satisfies cluster properties for systems of\nless than four particles. Different forms of dynamics are related by unitary\ntransformations that remove interactions from some infinitesimal generators and\nintroduce them to other generators. These unitary transformation must be\ninteraction dependent, because they can be applied to a non-interacting\ngenerator and produce an interacting generator. This suggests that these\ntransformations can generate complex many-body forces when used in many-body\nproblems. It turns out that this is not the case. In all cases of interest the\nresult of applying the unitary scattering equivalence results in\nrepresentations that have simple relations, even though the unitary\ntransformations are dynamical. This applies to many-body models as well as\nmodels with particle production. In all cases no new many-body operators are\ngenerated by the unitary scattering equivalences relating the different forms\nof dynamics. This makes it clear that the various calculations used in\napplications that emphasize one form of the dynamics over another are\nequivalent. Furthermore, explicit representations of the equivalent dynamical\nmodels in any form of dynamics are easily constructed. Where differences do\nappear is when electromagnetic probes are treated in the one-photon exchange\napproximation. This approximation is different in each of Dirac's forms of\ndynamics.\n"}

Here, a general method for effective OEP-based elimination\nof electron repulsion integrals (ERI), that is tuned towards the fragment-based\ncalculation methodologies such as the second generation of the effective\nfragment potentials (EFP2) method, is presented. Two general types of the OEP\noperator matrix elements are distinguished and treated either via the\ndistributed multipole expansion or the extended density fitting schemes\ndeveloped in this work. The OEP technique is then applied to address the\nproblem of using incomplete EFP2 settings in many applications in interaction\nenergy and molecular dynamics simulations due to relatively high computational\ncost of evaluating the charge transfer (CT) effects as compared to other\neffects. The alternative OEP-based CT energy model is proposed in the context\nof the intermolecular perturbation theory with Hartree-Fock non-interacting\ngas-phase reference wavefunctions, compatible with the EFP2 formulation. It is\nfound that the computational cost can be reduced up to 20 times as compared to\nthe CT energy method within the EFP2 scheme without compromising the accuracy\nfor a wide range of weakly interacting neutral molecular complexes. Therefore,\nit is believed that the proposed model can be used within the EFP2 framework,\nmaking the CT energy term no longer the bottleneck in EFP2-based simulations of\ncomplex systems.\n"}

We compare our results to continuum expressions obtained using hard\nthermal loop theory and to semi-analytic lattice perturbation theory\ncalculations using the hard classical loop formalism. We find that, when\nplotted as a function of $m_D r$, where $m_D$ is the hard classical loop Debye\nmass, the imaginary part of the heavy-quark potential shows little sensitivity\nto the lattice spacing at small $m_D r \\lesssim 1$ and agrees well with the\nsemi-analytic hard classical loop result.

The\nself-consistent changes in electronic structure reflected in the corresponding\nchanges in external potential comprise formal properties of the Hohenberg-Kohn\ntheorems.

A significant threat to these Mediterranean rangelands is\nrelated to uncontrolled fires that can cause potential damages due to the\nreduction or even the loss of ecosystems. Our results show that time series of\nforest and grassland for unburned and burned areas are characterized by both\nperiodic and chaotic components. The fire event caused a clear simplification\nof vegetation structures as well as of SEL dynamics that is more regular and\npredictable after the burning and less chaotic. However grassland evolution\ncould be more predictable than forest considering the effect of fire\ndisturbance on successional cycles and stages of the two land-cover types. In\nparticular, we applied recurrence analysis with sliding temporal windows\nthree-year length on the original time series. This analysis indicates that\ngrasslands and forests behaved similarly in correspondence with the burning,\nalthough their phase states slowly diverge after fire. Recurrence is useful to\nstudy the vegetation recovery as it enables mapping landscape transitions\nderived from remote sensing.

For that sake, three categories of specimens\nwere analyzed: as-deposited, annealed at 300{\\deg}C, and annealed at\n600{\\deg}C. It was found that the presence of residual oxygen into the\nannealing atmosphere resulted in a substantial oxidation of the Er film\nsurface, irrespective of the annealing temperature.

The extensive duration of this experiment provides a\nunique window into the effects of epistasis during long-term adaptation to a\nconstant environment. Guided by analytical results in the weak-mutation limit,\nwe develop a computational framework to assess the compatibility of a given\nepistatic model with the observed patterns of fitness gain and mutation\naccumulation through time. We find that a decelerating fitness trajectory alone\nprovides little power to distinguish between competing models, including those\nthat lack any direct epistatic interactions between mutations. However, when\ncombined with the mutation trajectory, these observables place strong\nconstraints on the set of possible models of epistasis, ruling out many\nexisting explanations of the data. Instead, we find that the data are\nconsistent with \"two-epoch\" model of adaptation, in which an initial burst of\ndiminishing returns epistasis is followed by a steady accumulation of mutations\nunder a constant distribution of fitness effects.

{"title": "A fast online cascaded regression algorithm for face alignment", "trgt": "  Traditional face alignment based on machine learning usually tracks the\nlocalizations of facial landmarks employing a static model trained offline\nwhere all of the training data is available in advance. When new training\nsamples arrive, the static model must be retrained from scratch, which is\nexcessively time-consuming and memory-consuming. In many real-time\napplications, the training data is obtained one by one or batch by batch. It\nresults in that the static model limits its performance on sequential images\nwith extensive variations. Therefore, the most critical and challenging aspect\nin this field is dynamically updating the tracker's models to enhance\npredictive and generalization capabilities continuously. In order to address\nthis question, we develop a fast and accurate online learning algorithm for\nface alignment. Particularly, we incorporate on-line sequential extreme\nlearning machine into a parallel cascaded regression framework, coined\nincremental cascade regression(ICR). To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst incremental cascaded framework with the non-linear regressor. One main\nadvantage of ICR is that the tracker model can be fast updated in an\nincremental way without the entire retraining process when a new input is\nincoming. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ICR is more\naccurate and efficient on still or sequential images compared with the recent\nstate-of-the-art cascade approaches.

Fossil and non-fossil systems could have different galaxy\npopulations that should be reflected in their luminosity functions. In this\nwork we study, for the first time, the dependence of the luminosity function\nparameters on $\\Delta m_{12}$ using data obtained by the fossil group origins\n(FOGO) project.

For Cayley trees, we derive an exact analytic formula\nfor the ATT to an arbitrary trap node, based on which we further obtain the\nexplicit expression of ATT for the case that the trap is uniformly distributed.\nFor Vicsek fractals, we provide the closed-form solution for ATT to a\nperipheral node farthest from the central node, as well as the numerical\nsolutions for the case when the trap is placed on other nodes. Moreover, we\nderive the exact formula for the ATT corresponding to the trapping problem when\nthe trap has an uniform distribution over all nodes. Our results show that the\ninfluence of trap location on the trapping efficiency is completely different\nfor the two polymer networks. In Cayley trees, the leading scaling of ATT\nincreases with the shortest distance between the trap and the central node,\nimplying that trap's position has an essential impact on the trapping\nefficiency; while in Vicsek fractals, the effect of location of the trap is\nnegligible, since the dominant behavior of ATT is identical, respective of the\nlocation where the trap is placed.

We find that these two scenarios\nare strongly constrained by the predicted dark matter self-interactions and by\nlimits on millicharged dark matter respectively. We conclude that the 21-cm\nabsorption line is unlikely to be the result of gas cooling via the scattering\nwith a dominant component of the dark matter. An order 1\\% subcomponent of\nmillicharged dark matter remains a viable explanation.\n"}
{"title": "Chaotic Inflation in No-Scale Supergravity with String Inspired Moduli\n  Stabilization", "trgt": "  The simple chaotic inflation is highly consistent with the BICEP2 experiment,\nand no-scale supergravity can be realized naturally in various string\ncompactifications. Thus, we construct a chaotic inflation model in no-scale\nsupergravity inspired from Type IIB string compactification with an anomalous\nU(1)_X gauged symmetry. We introduce two moduli T_1 and T_2 which transform\nnon-trivially under U(1)_X, and some pairs of fundamental quarks charged under\nthe SU(N) x U(1)_X gauge group. The non-trivial transformations of moduli under\nU(1)_X lead to a moduli-dependent Fayet-Iliopoulos (FI) term. The modulus T_2\nand the real component of T_1 are stabilized by the non-perturbative effect\nfrom quark condensation and the U(1)_X D-term. In particular, the stabilization\nfrom the anomalous U(1)_X D-term with moduli-dependent FI term is crucial for\ninflation since it gives heavy mass to the real component of the modulus T_1\nwhile keeping its axionic part light. Choosing the proper parameters, we obtain\na global Minkowski vacuum where the imaginary part of T_1 has a quadratic\npotential for chaotic inflation.\n"}
{"title": "Efficient Algorithms for Convolutional Inverse Problems in\n  Multidimensional Imaging", "trgt": "  Multidimensional imaging, capturing image data in more than two dimensions,\nhas been an emerging field with diverse applications. Due to the limitation of\ntwo-dimensional detectors in obtaining the high-dimensional image data,\ncomputational imaging approaches have been developed to pass on some of the\nburden to a reconstruction algorithm. In various image reconstruction problems\nin multidimensional imaging, the measurements are in the form of superimposed\nconvolutions. In this paper, we introduce a general framework for the solution\nof these problems, called here convolutional inverse problems, and develop fast\nimage reconstruction algorithms with analysis and synthesis priors. These\ninclude sparsifying transforms, as well as convolutional or patch-based\ndictionaries that can adapt to correlations in different dimensions. The\nresulting optimization problems are solved via alternating direction method of\nmultipliers with closed-form, efficient, and parallelizable update steps. To\nillustrate their utility and versatility, the developed algorithms are applied\nto three-dimensional image reconstruction problems in computational spectral\nimaging for cases with or without correlation along the third dimension. As the\nadvent of multidimensional imaging modalities expands to perform sophisticated\ntasks, these algorithms are essential for fast iterative reconstruction in\nvarious large-scale problems.\n"}
{"title": "Observational studies of stellar black hole binaries and ULXs", "trgt": "  We outline a framework for understanding the X-ray spectra of high mass\naccretion rate stellar black holes based on X-ray data from RXTE and ASCA.\nThree spectral regimes can be separated out by the behaviour of the observed\ndisk luminosity and temperature. The well established \"standard regime\" is seen\nwhen the disk dominates the spectrum, where only a small fraction of the\nluminosity is emitted in the power law tail. These spectra generally satisfy\nthe standard relation expected for thermal emission from a constant area,\nnamely that the disk bolometric luminosity, Ldisk, is proportional to its\nmaximum temperature, Tin^4. However, at higher luminosities this starts to\nchange to Tin^2. This \"apparently standard regime\" is still dominated by the\ndisk emission, but this difference luminosity-temperature relation and subtle\nchanges in spectral shape may show that another cooling process is required in\naddition to radiative cooling. At intermediate luminosities there is an\nanomalous regime (or weak very high state) where the disk temperature and\nluminosity are less clearly related. These spectra are characterized by the\npresence of a much stronger comptonized tail indicating high energy electrons.\nWhen observed disk emission is corrected for the the effects of comptonisation\nthen these points lie back on the standard relation. The growth of this\ncomptonising corona is also clearly linked to the quasi-periodic oscillations,\nas these are observed preferentially in the anomalous regime. This presented\npicture was found to explain the spectral behavior of both black hole binaries\nin our Galaxy and LMC. Spectral evolution of several bright ULXs observed with\nASCA were also successfully explained in the same picture.\n"}

{"title": "Nonlinear 3D Face Morphable Model", "trgt": "  As a classic statistical model of 3D facial shape and texture, 3D Morphable\nModel (3DMM) is widely used in facial analysis, e.g., model fitting, image\nsynthesis. Conventional 3DMM is learned from a set of well-controlled 2D face\nimages with associated 3D face scans, and represented by two sets of PCA basis\nfunctions. Due to the type and amount of training data, as well as the linear\nbases, the representation power of 3DMM can be limited. To address these\nproblems, this paper proposes an innovative framework to learn a nonlinear 3DMM\nmodel from a large set of unconstrained face images, without collecting 3D face\nscans. Specifically, given a face image as input, a network encoder estimates\nthe projection, shape and texture parameters. Two decoders serve as the\nnonlinear 3DMM to map from the shape and texture parameters to the 3D shape and\ntexture, respectively. With the projection parameter, 3D shape, and texture, a\nnovel analytically-differentiable rendering layer is designed to reconstruct\nthe original input face. The entire network is end-to-end trainable with only\nweak supervision. We demonstrate the superior representation power of our\nnonlinear 3DMM over its linear counterpart, and its contribution to face\nalignment and 3D reconstruction.\n"}

Since the Carrier-Greenspan transform, while linearizing the\nshallow water system, seriously entangles the IBV in the hodograph plane, all\nprevious solutions required some restrictive assumptions on the IBV conditions,\ne.g., zero initial velocity, smallness of boundary conditions. For arbitrary\nnon-breaking initial conditions in the physical space, we present an explicit\nformula for equivalent IBV conditions in the hodograph plane, which can readily\nbe treated by conventional methods. Our procedure, which we call the method of\ndata projection, is based on the Taylor formula and allows us to reduce the\ntransformed IBV data given on curves in the hodograph plane to the equivalent\ndata on lines.

{"title": "Metric Distortion of Social Choice Rules: Lower Bounds and Fairness\n  Properties", "trgt": "  We study social choice rules under the utilitarian distortion framework, with\nan additional metric assumption on the agents' costs over the alternatives. In\nthis approach, these costs are given by an underlying metric on the set of all\nagents plus alternatives. Social choice rules have access to only the ordinal\npreferences of agents but not the latent cardinal costs that induce them.\nDistortion is then defined as the ratio between the social cost (typically the\nsum of agent costs) of the alternative chosen by the mechanism at hand, and\nthat of the optimal alternative chosen by an omniscient algorithm. The\nworst-case distortion of a social choice rule is, therefore, a measure of how\nclose it always gets to the optimal alternative without any knowledge of the\nunderlying costs. Under this model, it has been conjectured that Ranked Pairs,\nthe well-known weighted-tournament rule, achieves a distortion of at most 3\n[Anshelevich et al. 2015]. We disprove this conjecture by constructing a\nsequence of instances which shows that the worst-case distortion of Ranked\nPairs is at least 5. Our lower bound on the worst case distortion of Ranked\nPairs matches a previously known upper bound for the Copeland rule, proving\nthat in the worst case, the simpler Copeland rule is at least as good as Ranked\nPairs. And as long as we are limited to (weighted or unweighted) tournament\nrules, we demonstrate that randomization cannot help achieve an expected\nworst-case distortion of less than 3.

We aim to recover\nSVBRDFs from a single image, without any datasets. A single image contains\nincomplete information about the SVBRDF, making the reconstruction task highly\nill-posed. It is also difficult to separate between the changes in color that\nare caused by the material and those caused by the illumination, without the\nprior knowledge learned from the dataset.

We define a reward function to measure whether the projected dense\n3D model is well-aligned with the confidence maps generated by two fully\nconvolutional networks, and use the function to train recurrent policy networks\nto move the SensiblePoints. The same reward function is employed in testing to\nselect the best hypothesis from a candidate pool of hypotheses.

Data can be shown in-situ, thereby enabling real-time visual\ncomparisons and object search in real-life user tasks, such as comparing\nproducts and looking up scores in a sports game. While there have been studies\non designing AR interfaces for situated information retrieval, there has only\nbeen limited research on AR object labeling for visual search tasks in the\nspatial environment. In this paper, we identify and categorize different design\naspects in AR label design and report on a formal user study on labels for\nout-of-view objects to support visual search tasks in AR. We design three\nvisualization techniques for out-of-view object labeling in AR, which\nrespectively encode the relative physical position (height-encoded), the\nrotational direction (angle-encoded), and the label values (value-encoded) of\nthe objects. We further implement two traditional in-view object labeling\ntechniques, where labels are placed either next to the respective objects\n(situated) or at the edge of the AR FoV (boundary). We evaluate these five\ndifferent label conditions in three visual search tasks for static objects. Our\nstudy shows that out-of-view object labels are beneficial when searching for\nobjects outside the FoV, spatial orientation, and when comparing multiple\nspatially sparse objects. Angle-encoded labels with directional cues of the\nsurrounding objects have the overall best performance with the highest user\nsatisfaction.

{"title": "Three-Dimensional Numerical Modeling of Shear Stimulation of Naturally\n  Fractured Reservoirs", "trgt": "  Shear dilation based hydraulic stimulations enable exploitation of geothermal\nenergy from reservoirs with inadequate initial permeability. While contributing\nto enhancing the reservoir's permeability, hydraulic stimulation processes may\nlead to undesired seismic activity. Here, we present a three dimensional\nnumerical model aiming to increase understanding of this mechanism and its\nconsequences. The fractured reservoir is modeled as a network of explicitly\nrepresented large scale fractures immersed in a permeable rock matrix. The\nnumerical formulation is constructed by coupling three physical processes:\nfluid flow, fracture deformation, and rock matrix deformation. For flow\nsimulations, the discrete fracture matrix model is used, which allows the fluid\ntransport from high permeable conductive fractures to the rock matrix and vice\nversa. The mechanical behavior of the fractures is modeled using a hyperbolic\nmodel with reversible and irreversible deformations. Linear elasticity is\nassumed for the mechanical deformation and stress alteration of the rock\nmatrix. Fractures are modeled as lower dimensional surfaces embodied in the\ndomain, subjected to specific governing equations for their deformation along\nthe tangential and normal directions. Both the fluid flow and momentum balance\nequations are approximated by finite volume discretizations. The new numerical\nmodel is demonstrated considering a three dimensional fractured formation with\na network of 20 explicitly represented fractures. The effects of fluid exchange\nbetween fractures and rock matrix on the permeability evolution and the\ngenerated seismicity are examined for test cases resembling realistic reservoir\nconditions.\n"}

While secular variations, as identified in previous\nanalyses, are recovered, short-term variations are detected for the first time.\nConcurrently, a significant decrease of approx. 2.5x10-3 cm-3 pc in the\ndispersion measure associated with PSR J2051-0827 is measured for the first\ntime and improvements are also made to estimates of the proper motion. Finally,\nPSR J2051-0827 is shown to have entered a relatively stable state suggesting\nthe possibility of its eventual inclusion in pulsar timing arrays.\n"}

The gas bar is about 100 pc\nlong with a visual extinction in excess of 10 mag. Indication for the gaseous\nnature of this bar comes from the lack of a stellar counterpart even in the K\nband where the extinction is greatly reduced.\n  We also use the NICMOS emission line images (Pa-alpha, [SiVI], and [FeII]) to\nstudy the innermost region of the ionization cones and the nuclear star forming\nactivity.

{"title": "An investigation of pre-crystalline order, ruling out Pauli crystals and\n  introducing Pauli anti-crystals", "trgt": "  Fluid states of matter can locally exhibit characteristics of the onset of\ncrystalline order. Traditionally this has been theoretically investigated using\nmultipoint correlation functions. However new measurement techniques now allow\nmultiparticle configurations of cold atomic systems to be observed directly.\nThis has led to a search for new techniques to characterize the configurations\nthat are likely to be observed. One of these techniques is the configuration\ndensity (CD), which has been used to argue for the formation of \"Pauli\ncrystals\" by non-interacting electrons in e.g. a harmonic trap. We show here\nthat such Pauli crystals do not exist, but that other other interesting spatial\nstructures can occur in the form of an \"anti-Crystal\", where the fermions\npreferentially avoid a lattice of positions surrounding any given fermion.\nFurther, we show that configuration densities must be treated with great care\nas naive application can lead to the identification of crystalline structures\nwhich are artifacts of the method and of no physical significance. We analyze\nthe failure of the CD and suggest methods that might be more suitable for\ncharacterizing multiparticle correlations which may signal the onset of\ncrystalline order. In particular, we introduce neighbour counting statistics\n(NCS), which is the full counting statistics of the particle number in a\nneighborhood of a given particle. We test this on two dimensional systems with\nemerging triangular and square crystal structures.\n"}

We leverage this property to\nresolve entities across the different web sites, and find that we can obtain\nsubstantial improvements in resolution accuracy. This improvement in accuracy\nalso translates into robustness, which often reduces the amount of training\ndata that must be labeled for comparing entities across many sites.\nFurthermore, the technique provides robustness when resolving sites that have\nsome duplicates, even without first removing these duplicates. We present\nalgorithms with very strong precision and recall, and show that max weight\nmatching, while appearing to be a natural choice turns out to have poor\nperformance in some situations.

A resting cell excites if number of excited\nneighbours lies in a certain interval (excitation interval). An excited cell\nbecome refractory independently on states of its neighbours. A refractory cell\nreturns to a resting state only if the number of excited neighbours belong to\nrecovery interval. The model is an excitable cellular automaton abstraction of\na spatially extended semi-memristive medium where a cell's resting state\nsymbolises low-resistance and refractory state high-resistance. The medium is\nsemi-memristive because only transition from high- to low-resistance is\ncontrolled by density of local excitation. We present phenomenological\nclassification of the automata behaviour for all possible excitation intervals\nand recovery intervals. We describe eleven classes of cellular automata with\nretained refractoriness based on criteria of space-filling ratio, morphological\nand generative diversity, and types of travelling localisations.\n"}

In this article I sketch the beginnings of a\ntheory that would import these notions into the category of hedral sets in the\nsense of Morelli and the category of polyhedral sets in the sense of Schanuel.\nBoth of these theories can be viewed as extensions of the theory of finite sets\nand mappings between finite sets, with the concept of cardinality being\nreplaced by the more general notion of Euler measure (sometimes called\ncombinatorial Euler characteristic). I prove a ``functoriality'' theorem\n(Theorem 1) for subset-selection in the context of polyhedral sets, which\nprovides quasi-combinatorial interpretations of assertions such as $2^{-1} =\n\\frac12$ and ${1/2 \\choose 2} = -\\frac18$. Furthermore, the operation of\nforming a power set can be viewed as a special case of the operation of forming\nthe set of all mappings from one set to another; I conclude the article with a\npolyhedral analogue of the set of all mappings between two finite sets, and a\nrestrictive but suggestive result (Theorem 2) that offers a hint of what a\ngeneral theory of exponentiation in the polyhedral category might look like.\n"}

{"title": "The Possible Effects of Personal Income Tax and Value Added Tax on\n  Consumer Behaviors", "trgt": "  In economics literature, it is accepted that all people are rational and they\ntry to maximize their utilities as possible as they can. In addition, economic\ntheories are formed with the assumptions not suitable to real life. For\ninstance, indifference curves are drawn with the assumptions that there are two\ngoods, people are rational, more is preferred to less and so on. Hence, the\nconsumer behaviors are guessed according to this analysis. Nevertheless, these\nare invalid in real life. And this inconsistencey are examined by behavioral\neconomics and neuroeconomics. Behavioral economics claims that people can\nbehave what they are not expected since people can be irrational, their\nwillpower is limited and altruistic behaviors can be seen and they can give\nmore value to what they own. As a result of these, consumer behaviors become\nmore different than that of economic theory. In addition to behavioral\neconomics, neuroeconomics also examines consumer behaviors more differently\nthan mainstream economic theory. It emphasizes the people using prefrontial\ncortex of the brain are more rational than the people using hippocampus of the\nbrain. Therefore, people can make illogical choices compared to economic\ntheory. In these cases, levying taxes such as personal income tax or value\nadded tax can be ineffective or effective. In other words, the effect becomes\nambigious. Hence,the hypothesis that if government desires to levy personal\nincome tax or value added tax, it makes a detailed research in terms of\nproductivity of taxes forms the fundamental of this study.\n"}

The X-ray spectra are consistent with nearly\ncritical accretion onto black holes of a few 10^3 to 10^8 M_Sun, although\nsupercritical accretion is possibly taking place. In two TDEs, a spectral\nhardening is observed 6 months after the discovery. Four TDEs showed an optical\nbrightening apart from the X-ray outburst. The other 9 TDEs demonstrate no\noptical activity. All 13 TDEs are optically faint, with Lopt/Lx<0.3 (Lopt and\nLx being the g-band and 0.2-6 keV luminosity, respectively). We have\nconstructed a TDE X-ray luminosity function, which can be fit by a power law\nwith a slope of -0.6+/-0.2, similar to the trend observed for optically\nselected TDEs.

We describe the tensor correlations in 9Li\nfully in the tensor-optimized shell model, where the variation of the size\nparameters of the single particle orbits is essential for getting strong tensor\ncorrelations. We have shown in our previous study that in $^{10,11}$Li the\ntensor and pairing correlations in 9Li are Pauli-blocked by additional valence\nneutrons, which make the p-shell configurations pushed up in energy. As a\nresult, the $s^2$ valence neutron component increases to reveal the halo\nstructure of 11Li and the inversion phenomenon of the single particle spectrum\nin 10Li arises.

Furthermore, we reveal\nthat contributions from different excitation channels destructively interfere\nwith each other. This finding suggests a path to potentially enhance the HHG by\nblocking a part of the channels and canceling the destructive interference\nthrough band-gap or chemical potential manipulation.\n"}

Neural prostheses capable of multi-channel neural\nrecording, on-site signal processing, rapid symptom detection, and closed-loop\nstimulation are critical to enabling such novel treatments. However, the\nexisting closed-loop neuromodulation devices are too simplistic and lack\nsufficient on-chip processing and intelligence. In this paper, we first discuss\nboth commercial and investigational closed-loop neuromodulation devices for\nbrain disorders. Next, we review state-of-the-art neural prostheses with\non-chip machine learning, focusing on application-specific integrated circuits\n(ASIC). System requirements, performance and hardware comparisons, design\ntrade-offs, and hardware optimization techniques are discussed. To facilitate a\nfair comparison and guide design choices among various on-chip classifiers, we\npropose a new energy-area (E-A) efficiency figure of merit that evaluates\nhardware efficiency and multi-channel scalability. Finally, we present several\ntechniques to improve the key design metrics of tree-based on-chip classifiers,\nboth in the context of ensemble methods and oblique structures.\n"}

Different types of boundary\nconditions are discussed on the branes, including the bag boundary condition\nand the conditions arising in $Z_{2}$-symmetric braneworld models. Nonzero\nvacuum currents appear along the compact dimensions only. In the region between\nthe branes they are decomposed into the brane-free and brane-induced\ncontributions. Both these contributions are periodic functions of the magnetic\nflux enclosed by compact dimensions with the period equal to the flux quantum.\nDepending on the boundary conditions, the presence of the branes can either\nincrease or decrease the vacuum current density. For a part of boundary\nconditions, a memory effect is present in the limit when one of the branes\ntends to the AdS boundary.

By a systematic analysis of\nmagnetic point groups, we show that the ME sum rule is applicable to a broad\nvariety of non-centrosymmetric magnets including ME multiferroic compounds. Due\nto the dynamical ME effect, the optical excitations in these materials can\nexhibit directional dichroism, i.e. the absorption coefficient can be different\nfor counter-propagating light beams. According to the ME sum rule, the\nmagnitude of the linear ME effect of a material is mainly determined by the\ndirectional dichroism of its low-energy optical excitations. Application of the\nsum rule to the multiferroic Ba$_2$CoGe$_2$O$_7$, Sr$_2$CoSi$_2$O$_7$ and\nCa$_2$CoSi$_2$O$_7$ shows that in these compounds the static ME effect is\nmostly governed by the directional dichroism of the spin-wave excitations in\nthe GHz-THz spectral range.

{"title": "Estimating Parkinsonism Severity in Natural Gait Videos of Older Adults\n  with Dementia", "trgt": "  Drug-induced parkinsonism affects many older adults with dementia, often\ncausing gait disturbances. New advances in vision-based human pose-estimation\nhave opened possibilities for frequent and unobtrusive analysis of gait in\nresidential settings. This work leverages novel spatial-temporal graph\nconvolutional network (ST-GCN) architectures and training procedures to predict\nclinical scores of parkinsonism in gait from video of individuals with\ndementia. We propose a two-stage training approach consisting of a\nself-supervised pretraining stage that encourages the ST-GCN model to learn\nabout gait patterns before predicting clinical scores in the finetuning stage.\nThe proposed ST-GCN models are evaluated on joint trajectories extracted from\nvideo and are compared against traditional (ordinal, linear, random forest)\nregression models and temporal convolutional network baselines. Three 2D human\npose-estimation libraries (OpenPose, Detectron, AlphaPose) and the Microsoft\nKinect (2D and 3D) are used to extract joint trajectories of 4787 natural\nwalking bouts from 53 older adults with dementia. A subset of 399 walks from 14\nparticipants is annotated with scores of parkinsonism severity on the gait\ncriteria of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and the\nSimpson-Angus Scale (SAS). Our results demonstrate that ST-GCN models operating\non 3D joint trajectories extracted from the Kinect consistently outperform all\nother models and feature sets. Prediction of parkinsonism scores in natural\nwalking bouts of unseen participants remains a challenging task, with the best\nmodels achieving macro-averaged F1-scores of 0.53 +/- 0.03 and 0.40 +/- 0.02\nfor UPDRS-gait and SAS-gait, respectively.

HCN, HNC, and HCO+ are typically used as star\nformation indicators, tracing dense molecular hydrogen gas [n(H2) > 10^5,cm^-3]\nwithin star-forming molecular clouds. However, the strength of their respective\nline emission in the J=6-5 transitions in APM08279+5255 is extremely high,\nsuggesting that they are excited by another mechanism besides collisions in the\ndense molecular gas phase alone. We derive J=6-5 line luminosities of\nL'(HCN)=(4.9+/-0.6), L'(HNC)=(2.4+/-0.7), and L'(HCO+)=(3.0+/-0.6)x10^10\n(mu_L)^-1 K km/s pc^2 (where mu_L is the lensing magnification factor),\ncorresponding to L' ratios of ~0.23-0.46 relative to CO(J=1-0). Such high line\nratios would be unusual even in the respective ground-state (J=1-0)\ntransitions, and indicate exceptional, collisionally and radiatively driven\nexcitation conditions in the dense, star-forming molecular gas in\nAPM08279+5255. Through an expansion of our previous modeling of the HCN line\nexcitation in this source, we show that the high rotational line fluxes are\ncaused by substantial infrared pumping at moderate opacities in a ~220K warm\ngas and dust component. This implies that standard M_dense/L' conversion\nfactors would substantially overpredict the dense molecular gas mass M_dense.\nWe also find a HCN J=6-5/5-4 L' ratio greater than 1 (1.36+/-0.31) - however,\nour models show that the excitation is likely not `super-thermal', but that the\nhigh line ratio is due to a rising optical depth between both transitions.\nThese findings are consistent with the picture that the bulk of the gas and\ndust in this source is situated in a compact, nuclear starburst, where both the\nhighly active galactic nucleus and star formation contribute to the heating.\n"}

The upper layer is filled by water and the lower one by sediment.\nThe key point falls on the definition of the friction laws between the two\nlayers, which are a generalization of those introduced in Fern\\'andez-Nieto et\nal. (ESAIM: M2AN, 51:115-145, 2017). This definition allows to apply properly\nthe two-layer shallow water model for the case of intense and slow bedload\nsediment transport. Moreover, we prove that the two-layer model converges to a\nSaint-Venant-Exner system (SVE) including gravitational effects when the ratio\nbetween the hydrodynamic and morphodynamic time scales is small. The SVE with\ngravitational effects is a degenerated nonlinear parabolic system. This means\nthat its numerical approximation is very expensive from a computational point\nof view, see for example T. Morales de Luna et al. (J. Sci. Comp., 48(1):\n258-273, 2011). In this work, gravitational effects are introduced into the\ntwo-layer system without such extra computational cost.

{"title": "Nonlinear optical absorption and photocurrents in topological insulators", "trgt": "  Theory of optical absorption of linearly and circularly polarized light in\nsurface and edge states in topological insulators is developed for a nonlinear\nin light intensity regime. The absorbance for surface states and the absorption\nwidth for the edge states both decease as $1/\\sqrt{I}$ at high light intensity\n$I$. Elastic scattering of the photoexcited electrons and holes is taken into\naccount. The absorption bleaching at high intensity is shown to be strongly\nsuppressed by the elastic scattering. The linear-circular dichroism of one- and\ntwo-photon absorption in surface states, emerging in the nonlinear in intensity\nregime, decreases due to the elastic scattering of photocarriers. Absorption in\nthe edge states of two-dimensional topological insulators also depends on the\nelastic scattering rate being suppressed when it is stronger that the energy\nrelaxation rate. The linear dichroism - a dependence of the absorption length\non the polarization plane orientation - is studied at arbitrary light\nintensities. We show that a degree of the linear dichroism is governed by the\nratio of the elastic and inelastic relaxation times. The photocurrents\ngenerated in the edge states by both linearly and circularly polarized light\nchange their intensity dependencies from the linear one at low $I$ to the\n$\\propto \\sqrt{I}$ at high intensities.

These\ndata encompass all the embedded protostars in the cloud and several Flat and\nClass II objects to produce the largest, homogeneous study of dust polarization\non disk scales to date. The goal of this study is to study dust polarization\ndown to disk scales. We find that 14/37 (38%) of the YSOs are detected in\npolarization. Nine of these sources have uniform polarization angles and four\nsources have azimuthal polarization. The sources with uniform polarization tend\nto have steeper inclinations (> 60 degree) than those with azimuthal\npolarization (< 60 degree). The majority (9/14) of the detected sources have\npolarization morphologies and disk properties consistent with dust\nself-scattering in optically thick disks. The remaining sources may be instead\ntracing magnetic fields. Their inferred field directions from rotating the\npolarization vectors by 90 degree are mainly poloidal or hourglass shaped.

In this paper, we tackle the problem of\nself-supervised temporal segmentation of long videos that alleviate the need\nfor any supervision. We introduce a self-supervised, predictive learning\nframework that draws inspiration from cognitive psychology to segment long,\nvisually complex videos into individual, stable segments that share the same\nsemantics. We also introduce a new adaptive learning paradigm that helps reduce\nthe effect of catastrophic forgetting in recurrent neural networks. Extensive\nexperiments on three publicly available datasets - Breakfast Actions, 50\nSalads, and INRIA Instructional Videos datasets show the efficacy of the\nproposed approach. We show that the proposed approach is able to outperform\nweakly-supervised and other unsupervised learning approaches by up to 24% and\nhave competitive performance compared to fully supervised approaches. We also\nshow that the proposed approach is able to learn highly discriminative features\nthat help improve action recognition when used in a representation learning\nparadigm.\n"}

Exploiting the possibly relevant inter-cell channel gains, rate\nsplitting with successive cancellation in both hops is investigated as a\npromising solution to improve the rate of basic single-rate communications.\nThen, an alternative solution is proposed that attempts to improve the\nperformance of the second hop (from the relays to base stations) by cooperative\ntransmission among the relay stations. The cooperative scheme leverages the\ncommon information obtained by the relays as a by-product of the use of rate\nsplitting in the first hop. Numerical results bring insight into the conditions\n(network topology and power constraints) under which rate splitting, with\npossible relay cooperation, is beneficial. Multi-cell processing (joint\ndecoding at the base stations) is also considered for reference.\n"}

{"title": "Real-space RG, error correction and Petz map", "trgt": "  There are two parts to this work:\n  First, we study the error correction properties of the real-space\nrenormalization group (RG). The long-distance operators are the (approximately)\ncorrectable operators encoded in the physical algebra of short-distance\noperators. This is closely related to modeling the holographic map as a quantum\nerror correction code. As opposed to holography, the real-space RG of a\nmany-body quantum system does not have the complementary recovery property. We\ndiscuss the role of large $N$ and a large gap in the spectrum of operators in\nthe emergence of complementary recovery.\n  Second, we study the operator algebra exact quantum error correction for any\nvon Neumann algebra. We show that similar to the finite dimensional case, for\nany error map in between von Neumann algebras the Petz dual of the error map is\na recovery map if the inclusion of the correctable subalgebra of operators has\nfinite index.\n"}

In this paper we study sub-surface reflection, which can\noccur without phase inversion, in the context of the two anomalous up-going\nevents reported by ANITA. We find that subsurface layers and firn density\ninversions may plausibly account for the events, while ice fabric layers and\nwind ablation crusts could also play a role. This hypothesis can be tested with\nradar surveying of the Antarctic region in the vicinity of the anomalous ANITA\nevents.

We have investigated the mechanism of formation and dynamical decoupling\nin such nested bars which include gaseous (secondary) nuclear bars within the\nfull size galactic disks, hosting a double inner Lindblad resonance. Becoming\nincreasingly massive and self-gravitating, the nuclear bars lose internal\n(circulation) angular momentum to the primary bars and increase their strength.\nDeveloping chaos within these bars triggers a rapid gas collapse -- bar\ncontraction. During this time period, the secondary bar pattern speed\nOmega_s~a^{-1}, where \"a\" stands for the bar size. As a result, Omega_s\nincreases dramatically until a new equilibrium is reached (if at all), while\nthe gas specific angular momentum decreases -- demonstrating the dynamical\ndecoupling of nested bars. Viscosity, and therefore the gas presence, appears\nto be a necessary condition for the prograde decoupling of nested bars.

The gamma process is introduced to\nsupport the convolution of countably infinite (stacked) covariate-dependent\ngamma distributions. For Bayesian inference, Gibbs sampling derived via novel\ndata augmentation and marginalization techniques is used to deconvolve and/or\ndemix the highly complex nonlinear predictive distribution.

While providing a rare opportunity to study in detail the remnant of\na Type IIb supernova, questions remain regarding the nature of its progenitor,\nits mass-loss history, and its pre-SN evolution. Here we present an optical\ninvestigation of the circumstellar environment around Cas A and find clumpy and\nfilamentary Halpha emission nebulosities concentrated 10-15 pc (10-15\narcminutes) to the north and east. First reported by Minkowski as a faint H II\nregion, these nebulosities exhibit distinct morphological and spectroscopic\nproperties relative to the surrounding diffuse emissions. Compared to\nneighboring H II regions, these nebulae show stronger [N II] 6548, 6583 A and\n[S II] 6716, 6731 A emissions relative to Halpha.

We interpret these surrounding\nnebulosities to be the remains of the progenitor's red supergiant wind which\naccumulated against the southern edge of a large extended H II region located\nnorth of Cas A. Our findings are consistent with the view that Cas A's\nprogenitor underwent considerable mass-loss, first from a fast main-sequence\nwind, then from a slower, clumpy red supergiant wind, and finally from a brief\nhigh-velocity wind, like that from a yellow supergiant.\n"}

Shapley and Shubik,\nDemange and Gale, and many others extended the model by allowing monetary\ntransfers. We offer a further extension by assuming that matched couples obtain\ntheir payoff endogenously as the outcome of a strategic game they have to play\nin a usual non-cooperative sense (without commitment) or in a semi-cooperative\nway (with commitment, as the outcome of a bilateral binding contract in which\neach player is responsible for his/her part of the contract).

In each case, we give the necessary and sufficient\nconditions for the set of stable allocations to be non-empty, we study its\ngeometry (full/semi-lattice), and provide an algorithm that converges to its\nmaximal element.

However, its performance is often limited by slow convergence and\ncorresponding low communication efficiency. In addition, since the available\nradio spectrum and IoT devices' energy capacity are usually insufficient, it is\ncrucial to control the resource allocation and energy consumption when\ndeploying FML in practical wireless networks. To overcome the challenges, in\nthis paper, we rigorously analyze each device's contribution to the global loss\nreduction in each round and develop an FML algorithm (called NUFM) with a\nnon-uniform device selection scheme to accelerate the convergence. After that,\nwe formulate a resource allocation problem integrating NUFM in multi-access\nwireless systems to jointly improve the convergence rate and minimize the\nwall-clock time along with energy cost. By deconstructing the original problem\nstep by step, we devise a joint device selection and resource allocation\nstrategy to solve the problem with theoretical guarantees. Further, we show\nthat the computational complexity of NUFM can be reduced from $O(d^2)$ to\n$O(d)$ (with the model dimension $d$) via combining two first-order\napproximation techniques. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the\neffectiveness and superiority of the proposed methods in comparison with\nexisting baselines.\n"}

Their spectra, $\\Sigma=$ spec $A$\nand $\\Sigma_+=$ spec $A_+$, are independent of $A$ and $A_+$ as long as $A$ and\n$A_+$ are pseudoergodic (in the sense of E.B. Davies, Commun. Math.

This was shown in Davies\n(2001) for $A$; that the same holds for $A_+$ is one main result of this paper.\nWe give upper and lower bounds on $\\Sigma$ and $\\Sigma_+$, and we explicitly\ncompute a set $G$ that fills the gap between the two in the sense that\n$\\Sigma\\cup G=\\Sigma_+$. We show that invertibility of one operator $A_+$\nimplies invertibility - and uniform boundedness of the inverses - of all finite\nsquare matrices with three diagonals in $U, V$ and $W$. This implies that the\nso-called finite section method for the approximate solution of a system\n$A_+x=b$ is applicable as soon as $A_+$ is invertible, and that the same method\nfor estimating the spectrum of $A_+$ does not suffer from spectral pollution.\nBoth results illustrate that tridiagonal stochastic Toeplitz operators share\nimportant properties of (classical) Toeplitz operators. One of our main tools\nis a new version of the Coburn lemma for classical Toeplitz operators, saying\nthat a stochastic tridiagonal Toeplitz operator, if Fredholm, is always\ninjective or surjective. In the final part we bound and compare the norms, and\nthe norms of inverses, of bi-infinite, semi-infinite and finite tridiagonal\nmatrices over $U$, $V$ and $W$.

{"title": "Moment dynamics for a class of time-triggered stochastic hybrid systems", "trgt": "  Stochastic Hybrid Systems (SHS) constitute an important class of mathematical\nmodels that integrate discrete stochastic events with continuous dynamics. The\ntime evolution of statistical moments is generally not closed for SHS, in the\nsense that the time derivative of the lower-order moments depends on\nhigher-order moments. Here, we identify an important class of SHS where moment\ndynamics is automatically closed, and hence moments can be computed exactly by\nsolving a system of coupled differential equations. This class is referred to\nas linear time-triggered SHS (TTSHS), where the state evolves according to a\nlinear dynamical system. Stochastic events occur at discrete times and the\nintervals between them are independent random variables that follow a general\nclass of probability distributions. Moreover, whenever the event occurs, the\nstate of the SHS changes randomly based on a probability distribution. Our\napproach relies on embedding a Markov chain based on phase-type processes to\nmodel timing of events, and showing that the resulting system has closed moment\ndynamics. Interestingly, we identify a subclass of linear TTSHS, where the\nfirst and second-order moments depend only on the mean time interval between\nevents and invariant of their higher-order statistics. Finally, we discuss\napplicability of our results to different application areas such as network\ncontrol systems and systems biology.\n"}

In addition,\ntemporal coherence of the two original resonating modes with respect to the\nabrupt temporal boundary is found to be strongly related to the amount of\nfrequency conversion as well as the phase of the converted wave.

In practice, the prognosis outcome data can be contaminated, and most of\nthe existing methods are not robust to data contamination. In the literature,\nit has been shown that even a single contaminated observation can lead to\nseverely biased model estimation. In this study, we describe prognosis using an\naccelerated failure time (AFT) model. An exponential squared loss is proposed\nto accommodate possible data contamination.

The\nquestion is whether disorders can also cause the higher-order topological\nphase.

We explore the properties of this mass\nejection mechanism over a range of stellar progenitors using\nspherically-symmetric, time-dependent hydrodynamic simulations that treat\nneutrino mass loss parametrically and follow the shock propagation over the\nentire star. We find that all types of stellar progenitor can eject mass\nthrough this mechanism.

Possible cosmic ray sources have\nnarrowed down with the confirmation of an ankle and the GZK-like spectral\nfeature at the highest energies. Anisotropies in the distribution of arrival\ndirections of cosmic rays at intermediate energies show a complex local\nneighborhood of the Galaxy. At the highest energies the dawn of particle\nastronomy is still challenging while composition related measurements point to\na change in the composition or the interaction of cosmic rays at ultrahigh\nenergies. A clear resolution of the ultrahigh energy mystery calls for a\nsignificant increase in statistics of cosmic ray and neutrino observations.\n"}
{"title": "Phylogenetic Factor Analysis", "trgt": "  Phylogenetic comparative methods explore the relationships between\nquantitative traits adjusting for shared evolutionary history. This adjustment\noften occurs through a Brownian diffusion process along the branches of the\nphylogeny that generates model residuals or the traits themselves. For\nhigh-dimensional traits, inferring all pair-wise correlations within the\nmultivariate diffusion is limiting. To circumvent this problem, we propose\nphylogenetic factor analysis (PFA) that assumes a small unknown number of\nindependent evolutionary factors arise along the phylogeny and these factors\ngenerate clusters of dependent traits. Set in a Bayesian framework, PFA\nprovides measures of uncertainty on the factor number and groupings, combines\nboth continuous and discrete traits, integrates over missing measurements and\nincorporates phylogenetic uncertainty with the help of molecular sequences. We\ndevelop Gibbs samplers based on dynamic programming to estimate the PFA\nposterior distribution, over three-fold faster than for multivariate diffusion\nand a further order-of-magnitude more efficiently in the presence of latent\ntraits. We further propose a novel marginal likelihood estimator for previously\nimpractical models with discrete data and find that PFA also provides a better\nfit than multivariate diffusion in evolutionary questions in columbine flower\ndevelopment, placental reproduction transitions and triggerfish fin\nmorphometry.\n"}
{"title": "Asynchronous Distributed Optimization with Redundancy in Cost Functions", "trgt": "  This paper considers the problem of asynchronous distributed multi-agent\noptimization on server-based system architecture. In this problem, each agent\nhas a local cost, and the goal for the agents is to collectively find a minimum\nof their aggregate cost. A standard algorithm to solve this problem is the\niterative distributed gradient-descent (DGD) method being implemented\ncollaboratively by the server and the agents. In the synchronous setting, the\nalgorithm proceeds from one iteration to the next only after all the agents\ncomplete their expected communication with the server. However, such synchrony\ncan be expensive and even infeasible in real-world applications. We show that\nwaiting for all the agents is unnecessary in many applications of distributed\noptimization, including distributed machine learning, due to redundancy in the\ncost functions (or {\\em data}). Specifically, we consider a generic notion of\nredundancy named $(r,\\epsilon)$-redundancy implying solvability of the original\nmulti-agent optimization problem with $\\epsilon$ accuracy, despite the removal\nof up to $r$ (out of total $n$) agents from the system. We present an\nasynchronous DGD algorithm where in each iteration the server only waits for\n(any) $n-r$ agents, instead of all the $n$ agents. Assuming\n$(r,\\epsilon)$-redundancy, we show that our asynchronous algorithm converges to\nan approximate solution with error that is linear in $\\epsilon$ and $r$.\nMoreover, we also present a generalization of our algorithm to tolerate some\nByzantine faulty agents in the system. Finally, we demonstrate the improved\ncommunication efficiency of our algorithm through experiments on MNIST and\nFashion-MNIST using the benchmark neural network LeNet.\n"}

In recent patents, it was shown that a significant part of the\nsurfactant contained in today formulations can be reduced by circa 50 % and\nreplaced by natural guar polymers without detrimental effects on the deposition\nand softening performances. We presently study the structure and rheology of\nthese softener formulations and identify the mechanisms at the origin of these\neffects.\n  The polymer additives used are guar gum polysaccharides, one cationic and one\nmodified through addition of hydroxypropyl groups. Formulations with and\nwithout guar polymers are investigated using optical and cryo-transmission\nelectron microscopy, small-angle light and Xray scattering and finally\nrheology. Similar techniques are applied to study the phase behavior of\nsoftener and cellulose nanocrystals considered here as a model for cotton.\n  The esterquat surfactants are shown to assemble into micron-sized vesicles in\nthe dilute and concentrated regimes. In the former, guar addition in small\namounts does not impair the vesicular structure and stability. In the\nconcentrated regime, cationic guars induce a local crowding associated to\ndepletion interactions and leads to the formation of a local lamellar order. In\nrheology, adjusting the polymer concentration at one tenth that of the\nsurfactant is sufficient to offset the decrease of the elastic property\nassociated with the surfactant reduction. In conclusion, we have shown that\nthrough an appropriate choice of natural additives it is possible to lower the\nconcentration of surfactants in fabric conditioners by about half, a result\nthat could represent a significant breakthrough in current home care\nformulations.\n"}

We use rank-$k$ truncated randomized SVD (TRSVD)\napproximations to $A$ by truncating the rank-$(k+q)$ RSVD approximations to\n$A$, where $q$ is an oversampling parameter. The resulting algorithms are\ncalled modified TRSVD (MTRSVD) methods.

We use our results to construct an\nimproved NNLO approximation for the pair invariant mass distribution and\ncompare it with previous, less complete approximations based on logarithmic\nterms from NNLL soft-gluon resummation alone. We find that the new NNLO\napproximation produces moderate enhancements of the differential cross section\ncompared to previous ones, the effect being slightly more important at low\nvalues of invariant mass than at high ones. On the other hand, at high values\nof invariant mass the new NNLO corrections are dominated by even higher-order\neffects included in NNLL soft-gluon resummation, reaffirming the need for\nresummation in describing the highly boosted regime.\n"}

For the eight sources with redshifts we\nmeasure linear sizes between 1 and 8 kpc with a median of 5 kpc.

Whereas properties such as rank, connectivity, and circuit size\nhave been well-studied, forbidden minors have not yet been analyzed. Here, we\ninvestigate the asymptotic probability as $n \\to \\infty$ that a fixed\n$\\mathbb{F}_q$-representable matroid $M$ is a minor of $M[A_n]$. (We always\nassume $m(n) \\geq \\text{rank}(M)$ for all sufficiently large $n$, otherwise $M$\ncan never be a minor of the corresponding $M[A_n]$.) When $M$ is free, we show\nthat $M$ is asymptotically almost surely (a.a.s.) a minor of $M[A_n]$.

{"title": "Improved Capacity Scaling in Wireless Networks With Infrastructure", "trgt": "  This paper analyzes the impact and benefits of infrastructure support in\nimproving the throughput scaling in networks of $n$ randomly located wireless\nnodes. The infrastructure uses multi-antenna base stations (BSs), in which the\nnumber of BSs and the number of antennas at each BS can scale at arbitrary\nrates relative to $n$. Under the model, capacity scaling laws are analyzed for\nboth dense and extended networks. Two BS-based routing schemes are first\nintroduced in this study: an infrastructure-supported single-hop (ISH) routing\nprotocol with multiple-access uplink and broadcast downlink and an\ninfrastructure-supported multi-hop (IMH) routing protocol. Then, their\nachievable throughput scalings are analyzed. These schemes are compared against\ntwo conventional schemes without BSs: the multi-hop (MH) transmission and\nhierarchical cooperation (HC) schemes. It is shown that a linear throughput\nscaling is achieved in dense networks, as in the case without help of BSs. In\ncontrast, the proposed BS-based routing schemes can, under realistic network\nconditions, improve the throughput scaling significantly in extended networks.\nThe gain comes from the following advantages of these BS-based protocols.\nFirst, more nodes can transmit simultaneously in the proposed scheme than in\nthe MH scheme if the number of BSs and the number of antennas are large enough.\nSecond, by improving the long-distance signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the\nreceived signal power can be larger than that of the HC, enabling a better\nthroughput scaling under extended networks. Furthermore, by deriving the\ncorresponding information-theoretic cut-set upper bounds, it is shown under\nextended networks that a combination of four schemes IMH, ISH, MH, and HC is\norder-optimal in all operating regimes.\n"}

By contrast,\nthe sample of Abell clusters that do not have an X-ray counterpart shows a\ngalaxy luminosity function with a steep faint end ($\\alpha \\simeq -1.6$). We\ninvestigate the possibility that cD halos could be formed by the disruption of\ngalaxies in rich relaxed clusters that show an apparently flat faint end galaxy\nluminosity function (Lopez-Cruz et al 1997).\n  We find that clusters dominated by a central cD galaxy (Bautz-Morgan classes\nI and II) show the same systematic trend: X-ray selected clusters have flatter\nfaint end slopes than those clusters with no detected X-ray emission. Thus, it\nis likely the X-ray selection and not the cluster domination by central\ngalaxies what correlates with background decontamination estimates of the\ngalaxy luminosity function. Moreover, no significant correlation between X-ray\nluminosity and the galaxy LF faint end slope is found. These results do not\nsupport a scenario where flat faint end slopes are a consequence of cD\nformation via the disruption of faint galaxies.

{"title": "Quantifying the Impact of Leveraging and Diversification on Systemic\n  Risk", "trgt": "  Excessive leverage, i.e. the abuse of debt financing, is considered one of\nthe primary factors in the default of financial institutions. Systemic risk\nresults from correlations between individual default probabilities that cannot\nbe considered independent. Based on the structural framework by Merton (1974),\nwe discuss a model in which these correlations arise from overlaps in banks'\nportfolios. Portfolio diversification is used as a strategy to mitigate losses\nfrom investments in risky projects. We calculate an optimal level of\ndiversification that has to be reached for a given level of excessive leverage\nto still mitigate an increase in systemic risk. In our model, this optimal\ndiversification further depends on the market size and the market conditions\n(e.g. volatility). It allows to distinguish between a safe regime, in which\nexcessive leverage does not result in an increase of systemic risk, and a risky\nregime, in which excessive leverage cannot be mitigated leading to an increased\nsystemic risk. Our results are of relevance for financial regulators.\n"}

We assume\na two-groups normal mixture model for the data and consider the asymptotic\nframework adopted in Bogdan et al. (2011) who introduced the notion of\nasymptotic Bayes optimality under sparsity in the context of multiple testing.\nThe general class of one-group priors under study is rich enough to include,\namong others, the families of three parameter beta, generalized double Pareto\npriors, and in particular the horseshoe, the normal-exponential-gamma and the\nStrawderman-Berger priors. We establish that within our chosen asymptotic\nframework, the multiple testing rules under study asymptotically attain the\nrisk of the Bayes Oracle up to a multiplicative factor, with the constant in\nthe risk close to the constant in the Oracle risk. This is similar to a result\nobtained in Datta and Ghosh (2013) for the multiple testing rule based on the\nhorseshoe estimator introduced in Carvalho et al. (2009, 2010). We further show\nthat under very mild assumption on the underlying sparsity parameter, the\ninduced decision rules based on an empirical Bayes estimate of the\ncorresponding global shrinkage parameter proposed by van der Pas et al.

Photometric pre-screening, based on the 100A-wide\nDDO51 band centered on the Mgb/MgH feature, was used to select spectroscopic\ntargets. Red giant candidates were targeted in a small field on M31's giant\nsouthern tidal stream at a projected distance of 31kpc from the galaxy center.\nWe isolate a clean sample of 68 giants by removing contaminants (foreground\nGalactic dwarfs and background galaxies) using spectroscopic, imaging, and\nphotometric methods. About 65% of the M31 stars are found to be members of the\nstream, while the rest appear to be members of the general halo population. The\nmean (heliocentric) radial velocity of the stream in our field is -458 km/s, or\n-158 km/s relative to M31's systemic velocity, in good agreement with recent\nmeasurements at other stream locations. The intrinsic velocity dispersion of\nthe stream is constrained to be 15_{-15}^{+8} km/s (90% confidence limits). The\ncompanion paper by Font et al. (2004, astro-ph/0406146) discusses possible\norbits, implications of the coldness of the stream, and progenitor satellite\nproperties.

Whereas a global fit\nto the latest data shows that some relation seems not to be favorable for a\nconsistent explanation to the current data within the standard model (SM). By\nconsidering several patterns of SU(3) breaking, the amplitudes and the\ncorresponding strong phases are extracted and compared with the theoretical\nestimations.

{"title": "An efficient preconditioner for the fast simulation of a 2D Stokes flow\n  in porous media", "trgt": "  We consider an efficient preconditioner for boundary integral equation (BIE)\nformulations of the two-dimensional Stokes equations in porous media. While\nBIEs are well-suited for resolving the complex porous geometry, they lead to a\ndense linear system of equations that is computationally expensive to solve for\nlarge problems. This expense is further amplified when a significant number of\niterations is required in an iterative Krylov solver such as GMRES. In this\npaper, we apply a fast inexact direct solver, the inverse fast multipole method\n(IFMM), as an efficient preconditioner for GMRES. This solver is based on the\nframework of $\\mathcal{H}^{2}$-matrices and uses low-rank compressions to\napproximate certain matrix blocks. It has a tunable accuracy $\\varepsilon$ and\na computational cost that scales as $\\mathcal{O} (N \\log^2 1/\\varepsilon)$. We\ndiscuss various numerical benchmarks that validate the accuracy and confirm the\nefficiency of the proposed method. We demonstrate with several types of\nboundary conditions that the preconditioner is capable of significantly\naccelerating the convergence of GMRES when compared to a simple block-diagonal\npreconditioner, especially for pipe flow problems involving many pores.\n"}
{"title": "Search-based Crash Reproduction using Behavioral Model Seeding", "trgt": "  Search-based crash reproduction approaches assist developers during debugging\nby generating a test case which reproduces a crash given its stack trace. One\nof the fundamental steps of this approach is creating objects needed to trigger\nthe crash. One way to overcome this limitation is seeding: using information\nabout the application during the search process. With seeding, the existing\nusages of classes can be used in the search process to produce realistic\nsequences of method calls which create the required objects. In this study, we\nintroduce behavioral model seeding: a new seeding method which learns class\nusages from both the system under test and existing test cases. Learned usages\nare then synthesized in a behavioral model (state machine). Then, this model\nserves to guide the evolutionary process. To assess behavioral model-seeding,\nwe evaluate it against test-seeding (the state-of-the-art technique for seeding\nrealistic objects) and no-seeding (without seeding any class usage). For this\nevaluation, we use a benchmark of 124 hard-to-reproduce crashes stemming from\nsix open-source projects. Our results indicate that behavioral model-seeding\noutperforms both test seeding and no-seeding by a minimum of 6% without any\nnotable negative impact on efficiency.\n"}

Herein, we\nfocus on the second part, i.e., a 3D pose estimation from 2D joint locations.\nThe problem with existing methods is that they require either (1) a 3D pose\ndataset or (2) 2D joint locations in consecutive frames taken from a video\nsequence. We aim to solve these problems. For the first time, we propose a\nmethod that learns a 3D human pose without any 3D datasets.

{"title": "Self-Paced Uncertainty Estimation for One-shot Person Re-Identification", "trgt": "  The one-shot Person Re-ID scenario faces two kinds of uncertainties when\nconstructing the prediction model from $X$ to $Y$. The first is model\nuncertainty, which captures the noise of the parameters in DNNs due to a lack\nof training data. The second is data uncertainty, which can be divided into two\nsub-types: one is image noise, where severe occlusion and the complex\nbackground contain irrelevant information about the identity; the other is\nlabel noise, where mislabeled affects visual appearance learning. In this\npaper, to tackle these issues, we propose a novel Self-Paced Uncertainty\nEstimation Network (SPUE-Net) for one-shot Person Re-ID. By introducing a\nself-paced sampling strategy, our method can estimate the pseudo-labels of\nunlabeled samples iteratively to expand the labeled samples gradually and\nremove model uncertainty without extra supervision. We divide the pseudo-label\nsamples into two subsets to make the use of training samples more reasonable\nand effective. In addition, we apply a Co-operative learning method of local\nuncertainty estimation combined with determinacy estimation to achieve better\nhidden space feature mining and to improve the precision of selected\npseudo-labeled samples, which reduces data uncertainty. Extensive comparative\nevaluation experiments on video-based and image-based datasets show that\nSPUE-Net has significant advantages over the state-of-the-art methods.\n"}

However, the existing DTA models do not explicitly\ndescribe one's selection of driving velocity on a road link. Driving velocity\nchoice may not be crucial for modeling the movement of human drivers but it is\na must-have control to maneuver AVs. In this paper, we aim to develop a\ngame-theoretic model to solve for AVs's optimal driving strategies of velocity\ncontrol in the interior of a road link and route choice at a junction node. To\nthis end, we will first reinterpret the DTA problem as an N-car differential\ngame and show that this game can be tackled with a general mean field\ngame-theoretic framework. The developed mean field game is challenging to solve\nbecause of the forward and backward structure for velocity control and the\ncomplementarity conditions for route choice. An efficient algorithm is\ndeveloped to address these challenges. The model and the algorithm are\nillustrated on the Braess network and the OW network with a single destination.\nOn the Braess network, we first compare the LWR based DTA model with the\nproposed game and find that the driving and routing control navigates AVs with\noverall lower costs.

{"title": "Last-use Opacity: A Strong Safety Property for Transactional Memory with\n  Early Release Support", "trgt": "  Transaction Memory (TM) is a concurrency control abstraction that allows the\nprogrammer to specify blocks of code to be executed atomically as transactions.\nHowever, since transactional code can contain just about any operation\nattention must be paid to the state of shared variables at any given time.\nE.g., contrary to a database transaction, if a TM transaction reads a stale\nvalue it may execute dangerous operations, like attempt to divide by zero,\naccess an illegal memory address, or enter an infinite loop. Thus\nserializability is insufficient, and stronger safety properties are required in\nTM, which regulate what values can be read, even by transactions that abort.\nHence, a number of TM safety properties were developed, including opacity, and\nTMS1 and TMS2. However, such strong properties preclude using early release as\na technique for optimizing TM, because they virtually forbid reading from live\ntransactions. On the other hand, properties that do allow early release are\neither not strong enough to prevent any of the problems mentioned above\n(recoverability), or add additional conditions on transactions with early\nrelease that limit their applicability (elastic opacity, live opacity, virtual\nworld consistency). This paper introduces last-use opacity, a new TM safety\nproperty that is meant to be a compromise between strong properties like\nopacity and serializability. The property eliminates all but a small class of\ninconsistent views and poses no stringent conditions on transactions. For\nillustration, we present a last-use opaque TM algorithm and show that it\nsatisfies the new safety property.\n"}

The transition to superconductive state is mainly determined\nby the properties of the rigid condensate of the \"strong\" band, while the\n\"weak\" band with a large coherence length of the Cooper pairs causes the\nnonlocality in fluctuation behaviour and break down of the simple\nGinzburg-Landau picture. As expected, the multiple-band electronic structure\ndoes not change the functional forms of dominating divergencies of the\nfluctuating corrections when the magnetic field approaches the upper critical\nfield. The temperature dependence of the coefficients, however, is modified.\nThe large in-plane coherence length sets the field scale at which the upper\ncritical field has upward curvature. The amplitude of fluctuations and\nfluctuation width enhances at this field scale due to reduction of the\neffective z-axis coherence length. We also observe that the apparent transport\ntransition displaces to lower temperatures with respect to the thermodynamic\ntransition. Even though this effect exists already in a single-band case at\nsufficiently high fields, it may be strongly enhanced in multiband materials.\n"}

FL\npreserves data privacy by exchanging the locally trained models of mobile\ndevices. By adopting SNNs as local models, FL can flexibly cope with the\ntime-varying energy capacities of mobile devices. Combining FL and SNNs is\nhowever non-trivial, particularly under wireless connections with time-varying\nchannel conditions. Furthermore, existing multi-width SNN training algorithms\nare sensitive to the data distributions across devices, so are ill-suited to\nFL. Motivated by this, we propose a communication and energy-efficient\nSNN-based FL (named SlimFL) that jointly utilizes superposition coding (SC) for\nglobal model aggregation and superposition training (ST) for updating local\nmodels.

The dynamic formation and melting behaviors of oxygen vacancy (VO)\norder are identified during the fatigue process. It reveals that the isolated\nVO tend to self-order along grain boundaries to form a planar-aligned\nstructure, which blocks the domain reversals. Upon further electrical cycling,\nmigration of VO within vacancy clusters is accommodated with a lower energy\nbarrier (~0.2 eV) and facilitates the formation of nearby-electrode layer\nincorporated with highly concentrated VO.

The RAF for BCGs is >30%, and depends on the cluster mass.\nCompare to the field population, cluster galaxies have 5-10 times higher RAF.\nCombining the AGN RLF and spatial distribution within clusters, we estimate\nthat they may inject an energy of ~0.13 keV per particle to the intracluster\nmedium near the cluster center. We also investigate the degree of contamination\nby cluster radio sources on the yields of SZE cluster surveys, and estimate\nthat as many as 10% of clusters detected at 150 GHz may host AGNs whose flux is\ncomparable to the cluster SZE signal.

For two-bridge hyperbolic knots we derive the colored\nHOMFLY invariants in terms of crossing matrices of the underlying\nWess-Zumino-Witten model. Our analysis extends previous works by incorporating\nnon-trivial multiplicities for the primaries appearing in the crossing\nmatrices, so as to describe colorings of HOMFLY invariants beyond the totally\nsymmetric or anti-symmetric representations of SU(N). The crossing matrices\ndirectly relate to 6j-symbols of the quantum group U_q(su(N)). We present\npowerful methods to calculate such quantum 6j-symbols for general N. This\nallows us to determine previously unknown colored HOMFLY polynomials for\ntwo-bridge hyperbolic knots. We give explicitly the HOMFLY polynomials colored\nby the representation {2,1} for two-bridge hyperbolic knots with up to eight\ncrossings.

Our goal is to find a spanning\ntree while minimizing the disutility, which is the sum of the tree cost and the\ntotal price that we spend on the studies. In a different application, each edge\ngives a stochastic reward value. Our goal is to find a spanning tree while\nmaximizing the utility, which is the tree reward minus the prices that we pay.\n  Situations such as the above two often arise in practice where we wish to\nfind a good solution to an optimization problem, but we start with only some\npartial knowledge about the parameters of the problem. The missing information\ncan be found only after paying a probing price, which we call the price of\ninformation.

Among them the\ndrifting QPPs are new and the most interesting, especially a bi-directional QPP\nat the time of the hard X-ray and $\\gamma$-ray peaks, and a sunquake start. In\nthe pre-impulsive phase we show an unusual drifting pulsation structure (DPS)\nin association with the EUV brightenings caused by the interaction of magnetic\nropes.

If the system mixes well\n(ergodicity), the QSS can be predicted by the statistical theory of Lynden-Bell\n(1967) based on the Vlasov equation. When the initial distribution takes only\ntwo values, the Lynden-Bell distribution is similar to the Fermi-Dirac\nstatistics. Such distributions have recently been observed in direct numerical\nsimulations of the HMF model (Antoniazzi et al. 2006). In this paper, we\ndetermine the caloric curve corresponding to the Lynden-Bell statistics in\nrelation with the HMF model and analyze the dynamical and thermodynamical\nstability of spatially homogeneous solutions by using two general criteria\npreviously introduced in the literature. We express the critical energy and the\ncritical temperature as a function of a degeneracy parameter fixed by the\ninitial condition. Below these critical values, the homogeneous Lynden-Bell\ndistribution is not a maximum entropy state but an unstable saddle point. We\napply these results to the situation considered by Antoniazzi et al. For a\ngiven energy, we find a critical initial magnetization above which the\nhomogeneous Lynden-Bell distribution ceases to be a maximum entropy state,\ncontrary to the claim of these authors. For an energy U=0.69, this transition\noccurs above an initial magnetization M_{x}=0.897. In that case, the system\nshould reach an inhomogeneous Lynden-Bell distribution (most mixed) or an\nincompletely mixed state (possibly fitted by a Tsallis distribution). Thus, our\ntheoretical study proves that the dynamics is different for small and large\ninitial magnetizations, in agreement with numerical results of Pluchino et al.\n(2004).

We prove a generalized Singleton bound for a given\nlist size, and conjecture that the bound is tight for most RS codes over large\nenough finite fields. We also show that the conjecture holds true for list\nsizes $2 \\text{ and }3$, and as a by product show that most RS codes with a\nrate of at least $1/9$ are list-decodable beyond the Johnson radius. Lastly, we\ngive the first explicit construction of such RS codes. The main tools used in\nthe proof are a new type of linear dependency between codewords of a code that\nare contained in a small Hamming ball, and the notion of cycle space from Graph\nTheory. Both of them have not been used before in the context of list-decoding.\n"}

Specifically, to articulate a sampling objective, we first assume\na super-resolution (SR) method based on feature graph Laplacian regularization\n(FGLR) that reconstructs the original high-resolution PC, given 3D points\nchosen by a sampling matrix $\\H$. We prove that minimizing a worst-case SR\nreconstruction error is equivalent to maximizing the smallest eigenvalue\n$\\lambda_{\\min}$ of a matrix $\\H^{\\top} \\H + \\mu \\cL$, where $\\cL$ is a\nsymmetric, positive semi-definite matrix computed from the neighborhood graph\nconnecting the 3D points. Instead, for fast computation we maximize a lower\nbound $\\lambda^-_{\\min}(\\H^{\\top} \\H + \\mu \\cL)$ via selection of $\\H$ in three\nsteps. Interpreting $\\cL$ as a generalized graph Laplacian matrix corresponding\nto an unbalanced signed graph $\\cG$, we first approximate $\\cG$ with a balanced\ngraph $\\cG_B$ with the corresponding generalized graph Laplacian matrix\n$\\cL_B$.

These,\nin passing through radiation fields and matter, produce neutrinos. Neutrino\ntelescopes are designed with large detection volumes to observe such\nastrophysical sources. A large volume is necessary because the fluxes and\ncross-sections are small. We estimate various telescopes' sensitivities and\nexpected event rates from astrophysical sources of high-energy neutrinos. We\nfind that an ideal detector of km^2 incident area can be sensitive to a flux of\nneutrinos integrated over energy from 10^5 and 10^{7} GeV as low as 1.3 *\n10^(-8) * E^(-2) (GeV/cm^2 s sr) which is three times smaller than the\nWaxman-Bachall conservative upper limit on potential neutrino flux.

The problem of multidimensional constellation design has\nbeen studied extensively in the literature in the context of multidimensional\ncoded modulation and space-time coded MIMO systems. Such constellations are\nformally called as lattice codes, where a finite set of points from a certain\nhigh dimensional lattice is chosen based on some criteria. In this paper, we\nconsider the problem of constellation/signal set design for media-based\nmodulation (MBM), a recent MIMO channel modulation scheme with promising\ntheoretical and practical benefits. Constellation design for MBM is\nfundamentally different from those for multidimensional coded modulation and\nconventional MIMO systems mainly because of the inherent sparse structure of\nthe MBM signal vectors. Specifically, we need a structured sparse lattice code\nwith good distance properties. In this work, we show that using an (N,K)\nnon-binary block code in conjunction with the lattice based multilevel squaring\nconstruction, it is possible to systematically construct a signal set for MBM\nwith certain guaranteed minimum distance. The MBM signal set obtained using the\nproposed construction is shown to achieve significantly improved bit error\nperformance compared to conventional MBM signal set. In particular, the\nproposed signal set is found to achieve higher diversity slopes in the\nlow-to-moderate SNR regime.\n"}

{"title": "The properties of dynamically ejected runaway and hyper-runaway stars", "trgt": "  Runaway stars are stars observed to have large peculiar velocities. Two\nmechanisms are thought to contribute to the ejection of runaway stars, both\ninvolve binarity (or higher multiplicity). In the binary supernova scenario a\nrunaway star receives its velocity when its binary massive companion explodes\nas a supernova (SN). In the alternative dynamical ejection scenario, runaway\nstars are formed through gravitational interactions between stars and binaries\nin dense, compact clusters or cluster cores. Here we study the ejection\nscenario. We make use of extensive N-body simulations of massive clusters, as\nwell as analytic arguments, in order to to characterize the expected ejection\nvelocity distribution of runaways stars. We find the ejection velocity\ndistribution of the fastest runaways (>~80 km s^-1) depends on the binary\ndistribution in the cluster, consistent with our analytic toy model, whereas\nthe distribution of lower velocity runaways appears independent of the binaries\nproperties. For a realistic log constant distribution of binary separations, we\nfind the velocity distribution to follow a simple power law; Gamma(v) goes like\nv^(-8/3) for the high velocity runaways and v^(-3/2) for the low velocity ones.\nWe calculate the total expected ejection rates of runaway stars from our\nsimulated massive clusters and explore their mass function and their binarity.\nThe mass function of runaway stars is biased towards high masses, and depends\nstrongly on their velocity. The binarity of runaways is a decreasing function\nof their ejection velocity, with no binaries expected to be ejected with v>150\nkm s^-1.

Radiative corrections produce an additional small vacuum misalignment,\nbreaking the electroweak symmetry down to $U(1)_{EM}$. Novel features of this\nmodel are: the only un-eaten pseudo-Goldstone boson in the effective theory is\nthe Higgs boson; the model contains a custodial symmetry, which ensures that\n$\\hat{T}=0$ at tree-level; and the potential for the Higgs boson is generated\nentirely through one-loop radiative corrections.

The complex magnetically tuned\nredshift-blueshift evolution of the transmission window is reasoned to result\nfrom the competition between the dynamic wire-wire interaction and the\nferromagnetic resonance of Fe-based wires. Increasing Co-based inter-wire\nspacing to 10 mm in the continuous hybrid composites, a remarkable dual-band\ntransmission window in the 1.5-3.5 GHz and 9-17 GHz is respectively induced by\nthe ferromagnetic resonance of Fe-based wires and the magnetic resonance\narising between Fe-Co wire couples. The hybridization of parallel Fe-based and\nshort-cut Co-based wires in the polymer composite leads to a significant\nenhancement of the transmission window in the frequency band of 1 to 6 GHz due\nto the band-stop nature of Co-based wires. The advanced hybridized microwire\nmetacomposites are arguably demonstrated to be particularly attractive for\nmicrowave cloaking and radio frequency barcoding applications.\n"}

The issue of projectability of these symmetries from tangent space\nto phase space is fully analyzed, and we give a geometrical interpretation of\nthe projectability conditions in terms of a relation between the Noether\nconserved quantity in tangent space and the presymplectic form defined on it.\nWe also examine the enlarged formalism that results from taking the Lagrange\nmultipliers as new dynamical variables; we find the equation that characterizes\nthe Noether symmetries in this formalism. The algebra of generators for Noether\nsymmetries is discussed in both the Hamiltonian and Lagrangian formalisms. We\nfind that a frequent source for the appearance of open algebras is the fact\nthat the transformations of momenta in phase space and tangent space only\ncoincide on shell. Our results apply with no distinction to rigid and gauge\nsymmetries; for the latter case we give a general proof of existence of Noether\ngauge symmetries for theories with first and second class constraints that do\nnot exhibit tertiary constraints in the stabilization algorithm. Among some\nexamples that illustrate our results, we study the Noether gauge symmetries of\nthe Abelian Chern-Simons theory in $2n+1$ dimensions.

The origin of these HJs remains unclear. This paper\ninvestigates the inward migration of giant planets due to Lidov-Kozai (LK)\noscillations induced by a distant (100-1000 AU) stellar companion. We conduct a\nlarge population synthesis study, including the octupole gravitational\npotential from the stellar companion, mutual precession of the host stellar\nspin axis and planet orbital axis, tidal dissipation in the planet, and stellar\nspin-down in the host star due to magnetic braking. We consider a range of\nplanet masses ($0.3-5\\,M_J$) and initial semi-major axes ($1-5$AU), different\nproperties for the host star, and varying tidal dissipation strengths. The\nfraction of systems that result in HJs depends on planet mass and stellar type,\nwith $f_{\\rm HJ} = 1-4\\%$ (depending on tidal dissipation strength) for\n$M_p=1\\,M_J$, and larger (up to $8\\%$) for more massive planets. The production\nefficiency of \"hot Saturns\" ($M_p=0.3M_J$) is much lower, because most\nmigrating planets are tidally disrupted. We find that the fraction of systems\nthat result in either HJ formation or tidal disruption, $f_{\\rm mig} \\simeq\n11-14\\%$ is roughly constant, having little variation with planet mass, stellar\ntype and tidal dissipation strength. This \"universal\" migration fraction can be\nunderstood qualitatively from analytical migration criteria based on the\nproperties of octupole LK oscillations.

As a test of\nthese models, we have obtained X-ray and optical data of the two massive\nedge-on spirals NGC 5746 and NGC 5170, in order to investigate the amount and\norigin of hot gas in their disks and halos. Chandra observations of NGC 5746\nreveal evidence for diffuse X-ray emission with a total luminosity of ~7 x\n10^39 erg/s surrounding this galaxy out to at least ~20 kpc from the disk,\nwhereas an identical study of the less massive NGC 5170 fails to detect any\nextraplanar X-ray emission. Unlike the case for other disk galaxies with\ndetected X-ray halos, the halo emission around NGC 5746 is not accompanied by\nextraplanar H-alpha or radio emission, and there is no evidence for significant\nnuclear or starburst activity in the disk. In contrast to these other cases,\nthe emission around NGC 5746 therefore appears to arise from the cooling of\nexternally accreted material rather than from disk outflows. To verify this\nidea, we present results of cosmological simulations of galaxy formation and\nevolution, showing our observations to be in good agreement with expectations\nfor cosmological accretion, while also confirming that the X-ray halos of other\nspirals do not fit well into an accretion scenario. We find that the estimated\ncooling rate of hot halo gas around NGC 5746 would provide sufficient material\nfor star formation in the disk to proceed at its present rate.

One of the\ngalaxies is a damped (DLA) absorber and these observations bear on the relation\nbetween the DLA clouds and the Lyman-break galaxies and the stage in the\nevolution of galaxies they represent. We describe a procedure for combining the\nundersampled WFPC2 images pointed on a sub-pixel grid, which largely recovers\nthe full sampling of the WFPC2 point spread function (psf). These three\ngalaxies have similar properties to the Lyman-break galaxies except that they\nhave strong Lyman alpha emission. The three galaxies are detected in all three\nbands, with average B~26, I~25. Two of the galaxies are compact with intrinsic\n(i.e. after correcting for the effect of the psf) half-light radii of ~0.1\narcsec (~0.4/h kpc, q_o=0.5). The third galaxy comprises two similarly compact\ncomponents separated by 0.3 arcsec. The HST images and a new ground-based Lyman\nalpha image of the field provide evidence that the three galaxies are more\nextended in the light of Lyman alpha than in the continuum. The measured impact\nparameters for this DLA galaxy (1.17 arcsec), for a second confirmed system,\nand for several candidates, provide a preliminary estimate of the\ncross-section-weighted mean radius of the DLA gas clouds at z~3 of less than\n13/h kpc, for q_o=0.5. Given the observed sky covering factor of the absorbers\nthis implies that for q_o=0.5 the space density of DLA clouds at these\nredshifts is more than five times the space density of spiral galaxies locally,\nwith the actual ratio probably considerably greater. For q_o=0.0 there is no\nevidence as yet that DLA clouds are more common than spiral galaxies locally.\n"}

We are using our large and highly complete\nCLASSIX survey of X-ray luminous galaxy clusters detected in the ROSAT All Sky\nSurvey to trace the matter distribution in the local Universe and to explore\nthe size of the flattened local density structure associated with the Local\nSupercluster. The Local Supercluster is oriented almost perpendicular to the\nGalactic plane. Since Galactic extinction increases towards the Galactic plane,\nobjects are on average more easily visible perpendicular to the plane than\nclose to it, also producing an apparent concentration of objects along the\nLocal Supercluster. We can correct for this bias by a careful treatment of the\nsurvey selection function. We find a significant overdensity of clusters in a\nflattened structure along the Supergalactic plane with a thickness of about 50\nMpc and an extent of about 100 Mpc radius. Structures at a distance larger than\n100 Mpc are not correlated to the Local Supercluster any more.

The accreted mass is calculated for disk masses of 0.01, 0.05 and 0.1\nM_sun with alpha = 1/2, 1, and 3/2. We show that a Jupiter-mass protoplanet can\naccrete 1 to 110 M_earth of heavy elements, depending on the disk properties.\nOur results explain the large variation in heavy element enrichment found in\nextra-solar giant planets. Since higher disk surface density is found to lead\nto larger heavy element enrichment, our model results are consistent with the\ncorrelation between heavy element enrichment and stellar metallicity.

{"title": "On the Capacity of Causal Cognitive Interference Channel With Delay", "trgt": "  In this paper, we introduce the Causal Cognitive Interference Channel With\nDelay (CC-IFC-WD) in which the cognitive user transmission can depend on $L$\nfuture received symbols as well as the past ones. Taking the effect of the link\ndelays into account, CC-IFC-WD fills the gap between the genie-aided and causal\n1cognitive radio channels. We study three special cases: 1) Classical CC-IFC\n(L=0), 2) CC-IFC without delay (L=1) and 3) CC-IFC with a block length delay\n(L=n). In each case, we obtain an inner bound on the capacity region. Our\ncoding schemes make use of cooperative strategy by generalized block Markov\nsuperposition coding, collaborative strategy by rate splitting, and\nGel'fand-Pinsker coding in order to pre-cancel part of the interference.\nMoreover, instantaneous relaying and non-causal partial Decode-and-Forward\nstrategies are employed in the second and third cases, respectively. The\nderived regions under special conditions, reduce to several previously known\nresults. Moreover, we show that the coding strategy which we use to derive\nachievable rate region for the classical CC-IFC achieves capacity for a special\ncase of this channel. Furthermore, we extend our achievable rate regions to\nGaussian case. Providing a numerical example for Gaussian CC-IFC-WD, we\ninvestigate the rate gain of the cognitive link for different delay values.\n"}
{"title": "File Transfer Application For Sharing Femto Access", "trgt": "  In wireless access network optimization, today's main challenges reside in\ntraffic offload and in the improvement of both capacity and coverage networks.\nThe operators are interested in solving their localized coverage and capacity\nproblems in areas where the macro network signal is not able to serve the\ndemand for mobile data. Thus, the major issue for operators is to find the best\nsolution at reasonable expanses. The femto cell seems to be the answer to this\nproblematic. In this work (This work is supported by the COMET project AWARE.\nhttp://www.ftw.at/news/project-start-for-aware-ftw), we focus on the problem of\nsharing femto access between a same mobile operator's customers.

The following article presents a distributed learning\nalgorithm with incomplete information running in SRCs software. We will then\nanswer the following questions for a game with $N$ SRCs and one SPC: how many\nconnections are necessary for each SRC in order to learn the strategy\nmaximizing its gain? Does this algorithm converge to a stable state? If yes,\ndoes this state a Nash Equilibrium and is there any way to optimize the\nlearning process duration time triggered by SRCs software?\n"}

Since they are acting on scales\ncomparable to the size of the objects, the uncertainty on these physical\nparameters is limited by the number of observational measurements, through\nsample variance. We propose a different and complementary approach for the\ncomputation of sample variance to repeating numerical simulations (i.e.\nMonte-Carlo sampling) by introducing new analytical developments for lines\ndiagnosis. We consider the model of a \"turbulent gas cloud\", consisting in\nisotropic and uniform turbulence described by a universal Kolmogorov\npower-spectrum with random amplitudes and phases in an optically thin medium.\nFollowing a simple prescription for the 4-term correlation of Fourier\ncoefficients, we derive generic expressions for the sample mean and variance of\nline centroid shift, line broadening and projected velocity structure function.\nWe perform a numerical validation based on Monte-Carlo simulations for two\npopular models of gas emissivity based on the beta-model.

Towards this goal, we\nintroduce SybilBelief, a semi-supervised learning framework, to detect Sybil\nnodes. SybilBelief takes a social network of the nodes in the system, a small\nset of known benign nodes, and, optionally, a small set of known Sybils as\ninput. Then SybilBelief propagates the label information from the known benign\nand/or Sybil nodes to the remaining nodes in the system.\n  We evaluate SybilBelief using both synthetic and real world social network\ntopologies. We show that SybilBelief is able to accurately identify Sybil nodes\nwith low false positive rates and low false negative rates. SybilBelief is\nresilient to noise in our prior knowledge about known benign and Sybil nodes.\nMoreover, SybilBelief performs orders of magnitudes better than existing Sybil\nclassification mechanisms and significantly better than existing Sybil ranking\nmechanisms.\n"}

{"title": "A Unifying Framework for Self-consistent Gravitational Lensing and\n  Stellar Dynamics Analyses of Early-Type Galaxies", "trgt": "  Gravitational lensing and stellar dynamics are two independent methods, based\nsolely on gravity, to study the mass distributions of galaxies. Both methods\nsuffer from degeneracies, however, that are difficult to break. In this paper,\nwe present a new framework that self-consistently unifies gravitational lensing\nand stellar dynamics. This approach breaks some of classical degeneracies that\nhave limited their individual usage, in particular in the study of\nhigh-redshift galaxies. The methodology is based on the premise that, for any\ngiven galaxy potential, the mapping of both the unknown lensed source\nbrightness distribution and the stellar phase-space distribution function on to\nthe photometric and kinematic observables, can be cast as a single set of\ncoupled linear equations. This set of linear equations is solved, maximizing\nthe likelihood penalty function. The evidence penalty function, as derived from\nBayesian statistics, subsequently allows the best potential-model parameters to\nbe found and potential-model families, or other model assumptions (e.g. PSF),\nto be quantitatively ranked. We have implemented a fast algorithm that solves\nfor the maximum-likelihood pixelized lensed source brightness distribution and\nthe two-integral stellar phase-space distribution function f(E, L_z), assuming\naxisymmetric potentials. To make the method practical, we have devised a new\nMonte-Carlo approach to Schwarzschild's orbital superposition method, based on\nthe superposition of two-integral (E and L_z) toroidal components, to find the\nmaximum-likelihood two-integral distribution function in a matter of seconds in\nany axisymmetric potential. The non-linear parameters of the potential are\nsubsequently found through a hybrid MCMC and Simplex optimization of the\nevidence. (Abridged)\n"}

By adding a strong repulsive Hubbard interaction $U$,\nwe can transform it into the regular Heisenberg anti-ferromagnet. While we can\nstudy our model in any dimension, as a first project we study it in one spatial\ndimension.

At large\nvalues of $U$ the model is equivalent to the isotropic spin-half\nanti-ferromagnetic chain, which is massless for topological reasons.

Thus, a\nblack hole broadens the line emission from monochromatic sources in its\nvicinity into a smoothly decaying \"red wing\"--whose flux vanishes at large\nredshift--together with a \"blue blade\" that retains finite flux up to a sharp\nedge corresponding to the maximum observable blueshift.

The construction uses a\nset of elementary pieces or fundamental anyon models, which constitute the\nbuilding blocks to construct other, more complex, anyon models. A principle of\nassembly is established that dictates how to articulate the building blocks,\nsetting out the global blueprint for the whole structure. Remarkably, the\nconstruction generates essentially all tabulated anyon models. Moreover, novel\nanyon models (non-tabulated, to my knowledge) arise. To embody the construction\nI develop a very physical, visual and intuitive lexicon. An anyon model\ncorresponds to a system of bosons in a lattice. By varying the number of bosons\nand the number of lattice sites, towers of more and more complex anyon models\nare built up. It is a Boson-Lattice construction. A self-similar anatomy is\nrevealed: an anyon model is a graph that is filled with bosons to engender a\nnew graph that is again filled with bosons. And further, bosons curve the graph\nthat the anyon model is: I disclose a geography in the space of anyon models,\nwhere one is born from another by deforming the geometry of space. I advance an\nalluring duality between anyon models and gravity.\n"}

The effect of divergence of walls of the channel,\nafter a sudden expansion, on the symmetry of flow and recirculation is studied\nfor various Reynolds numbers. It is seen that the angles of the walls play an\nactive role in disrupting the symmetry of flow. For non-parallel walls, the\nsymmetry breaking bifurcation phenomenon no longer exists and the loss of\nsymmetry is a gradual process.

The nodes in the\nnetwork are equipped with hardware clocks, but the rate of the hardware clocks\ncan vary arbitrarily within specific bounds, and the estimates that nodes can\nobtain about the clock values of other nodes are inherently inaccurate. Our\ngoal in this setting is to output a logical clock at each node such that the\nlogical clocks of any two nodes are not too far apart, and nodes that remain\nclose to each other in the network for a long time are better synchronized than\ndistant nodes. This property is called gradient clock synchronization.\n  Gradient clock synchronization has been widely studied in the static setting,\nwhere the network topology does not change. We show that the asymptotically\noptimal bounds obtained for the static case also apply to our highly dynamic\nsetting: if two nodes remain at distance $d$ from each other for sufficiently\nlong, it is possible to upper bound the difference between their clock values\nby $O(d \\log (D / d))$, where $D$ is the diameter of the network. This is known\nto be optimal even for static networks. Furthermore, we show that our algorithm\nhas optimal stabilization time: when a path of length $d$ appears between two\nnodes, the time required until the clock skew between the two nodes is reduced\nto $O(d \\log (D / d))$ is $O(D)$, which we prove to be optimal. Finally, the\ntechniques employed for the more intricate analysis of the algorithm for\ndynamic graphs provide additional insights that are also of interest for the\nstatic setting. In particular, we establish self-stabilization of the gradient\nproperty within $O(D)$ time.\n"}

However, due to the\ndiscrete nature of natural language, designing label-preserving transformations\nfor text data tends to be more challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel\ndata augmentation framework dubbed CoDA, which synthesizes diverse and\ninformative augmented examples by integrating multiple transformations\norganically. Moreover, a contrastive regularization objective is introduced to\ncapture the global relationship among all the data samples. A momentum encoder\nalong with a memory bank is further leveraged to better estimate the\ncontrastive loss. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we\napply CoDA to Transformer-based models on a wide range of natural language\nunderstanding tasks. On the GLUE benchmark, CoDA gives rise to an average\nimprovement of 2.2% while applied to the RoBERTa-large model. More importantly,\nit consistently exhibits stronger results relative to several competitive data\naugmentation and adversarial training base-lines (including the low-resource\nsettings). Extensive experiments show that the proposed contrastive objective\ncan be flexibly combined with various data augmentation approaches to further\nboost their performance, highlighting the wide applicability of the CoDA\nframework.\n"}

The allocation is done by a social planner who\nhas limited information because the agents' valuation functions are taken to be\nprivate information known only to the respective agents. We allow only a scalar\nsignal, called a bid, from each agent to the social planner. Yang and Hajek\n[Jour. on Selected Areas in Comm., 2007] as well as Johari and Tsitsiklis\n[Jour. of Oper.

{"title": "Optimization Induced Equilibrium Networks", "trgt": "  Implicit equilibrium models, i.e., deep neural networks (DNNs) defined by\nimplicit equations, have been becoming more and more attractive recently. In\nthis paper, we investigate an emerging question: can an implicit equilibrium\nmodel's equilibrium point be regarded as the solution of an optimization\nproblem? To this end, we first decompose DNNs into a new class of unit layer\nthat is the proximal operator of an implicit convex function while keeping its\noutput unchanged. Then, the equilibrium model of the unit layer can be derived,\nnamed Optimization Induced Equilibrium Networks (OptEq), which can be easily\nextended to deep layers. The equilibrium point of OptEq can be theoretically\nconnected to the solution of its corresponding convex optimization problem with\nexplicit objectives. Based on this, we can flexibly introduce prior properties\nto the equilibrium points: 1) modifying the underlying convex problems\nexplicitly so as to change the architectures of OptEq; and 2) merging the\ninformation into the fixed point iteration, which guarantees to choose the\ndesired equilibrium point when the fixed point set is non-singleton. We show\nthat deep OptEq outperforms previous implicit models even with fewer\nparameters. This work establishes the first step towards the\noptimization-guided design of deep models.\n"}

The formation and structure of the\nproto-atmosphere are subject to the planet--disk environment and orbital\neffects. Especially, when planets are on eccentric orbits, their relative\nvelocities to the gas can exceed the sound speed. The planets generate\natmosphere-stripping bow shocks. We investigate the proto-atmospheres on\nlow-mass planets with eccentric orbits with radiation-hydrodynamics\nsimulations. A 2D radiative model of the proto-atmosphere is established with\ntabulated opacities for the gas and dust. The solutions reveal large-scale gas\nrecycling inside a bow shock structure. The atmospheres on eccentric planets\nare typically three to four orders of magnitude less massive than those of\nplanets with circular orbits. Overall, however, a supersonic environment is\nfavorable for planets to keep an early stable atmosphere, rather than harmful,\ndue to the steady gas supply through the recycling flow. We also quantitatively\nexplore how such atmospheres are affected by the relative velocity of the\nplanet to the gas, the planet mass, and the background gas density. Our\ntime-dependent simulations track the orbital evolution of the proto-atmosphere\nwith the planet--disk parameters changing throughout the orbit. Atmospheric\nproperties show oscillatory patterns as the planet travels on an eccentric\norbit, with a lag in phase. To sum up, low-mass eccentric planets can retain\nsmall proto-atmospheres despite the stripping effects of bow shocks. The\natmospheres are always connected to and interacting with the disk gas.

Whereas black hole+O (BH+O)\nbinaries are thought to evolve from the former, only one such system is known\nin the Milky Way. To resolve this disparity, it was suggested that upon core\ncollapse, the WR stars receive large kicks such that most of the binaries are\ndisrupted. We reassess this issue, with emphasis on the uncertainty in the\nformation of an accretion disk around wind-accreting BHs in BH+O binaries,\nwhich is key to identifying such systems. We follow the methodology of previous\nwork and apply an improved analytic criterion for the formation of an accretion\ndisk around wind accreting BHs. We then use stellar models to predict the\nproperties of the BH+O binaries which are expected to descend from the observed\nWR+O binaries, if the WR stars would form BHs without a natal kick. We find\nthat disk formation depends sensitively on the O stars' wind velocity, the\nspecific angular momentum carried by the wind, the efficiency of angular\nmomentum accretion by the BH, and the spin of the BH. We show that the\nassumption of a low wind velocity may lead to predicting that most of the BH+O\nstar binaries will have an extended X-ray bright period. However, this is not\nthe case when typical wind velocities of O stars are considered. We find that a\nhigh spin of the BH can boost the duration of the X-ray active phase as well as\nthe X-ray brightness during this phase, producing a strong bias for detecting\nhigh mass BH binaries in X-rays with high BH spin parameters. We conclude that\nlarge BH formation kicks are not required to understand the sparsity of X-ray\nbright BH+O stars in the Milky Way. Probing for a population of X-ray silent\nBH+O systems with alternative methods can inform us about BH kicks and the\nconditions for high energy emission from high mass BH binaries. (Abridged)\n"}

{"title": "Periodic accretion-powered flares from colliding EMRIs as TDE Imposters", "trgt": "  When a main sequence star undergoes Roche lobe overflow onto a supermassive\nblack hole (SMBH) in a circular extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI), a phase of\nsteady mass transfer ensues. Over millions of years, the binary evolves to a\nperiod minimum before reversing course and migrating outwards. Because the time\ninterval between consecutive EMRIs is comparable to the mass-transfer\ntimescale, the semi-major axes of two consecutive mass-transferring EMRIs will\ncross on a radial scale < few AU. We show that such EMRI crossing events are\ninevitably accompanied by a series of mildly relativistic, grazing physical\ncollisions between the stars. Each collision strips a small quantity of mass,\nprimarily from the more massive star, which generally increases their radial\nseparation to set up the next collision after a delay of decades to centuries\n(or longer) set by further gravitational radiation. Depending on the mass of\nthe SMBH, this interaction can result in N ~ 1-1e4 gas production events of\nmass Msun/N, thus powering a quasi-periodic sequence of SMBH accretion-powered\nflares over a total duration of thousands of years or longer. Although the EMRI\nrate is 2-3 orders of magnitude lower than the rate of tidal disruption events\n(TDE), the ability of a single interacting EMRI pair to produce a large number\nof luminous flares - and to make more judicious use of the available stellar\nfuel - could make their observed rate competitive with the TDE rate, enabling\nthem to masquerade as \"TDE Imposters.\" We predict flares with luminosities that\ndecay both as power laws shallower than t^(-5/3) or as decaying exponentials.\nViscous spreading of the gas disks produced by the accumulation of previous\nmass-stripping events places substantial mass on radial scales > 10-100 AU,\nproviding a reprocessing source required to explain the unexpectedly high\noptical luminosities of some flares.\n"}

They have provided a combinatorial\ninterpretation of this parameter in terms of the eulerian subdigraphs of an\nappropriate orientation of $G$. Their characterization can be restated as\nfollows. Let $D$ be an orientation of $G$. Assign a weight $\\omega_D(H)$ to\nevery subdigraph $H$ of $D$: if $H \\subseteq D$ is eulerian, then $\\omega_D(H)\n= (-1)^{e(H)}$, otherwise $\\omega_D(H) = 0$.

We conclude by defining a confinement energy\ncondition that can be used to classify geometries incorporating totally\ngeodesic submanifolds, such as those found in thick braneworld and other\n5-dimensional scenarios.\n"}

CloudBuild, a distributed and caching build service\ndeveloped internally by Microsoft, runs the build process in parallel in the\ncloud and relies on caching to accelerate builds.

One of such misconceptions\nis related to arithmetic of natural numbers, which is extremely important both\nfor science and everyday life. People think their counting is governed by the\nrules of the conventional arithmetic and thus other kinds of arithmetics of\nnatural numbers do not exist and cannot exist. However, this popular image of\nthe situation with the natural numbers is wrong. In many situations, people\nhave to utilize and do implicitly utilize rules of counting and operating\ndifferent from rules and operations in the conventional arithmetic. This is a\nconsequence of the existing diversity in nature and society. To correctly\nrepresent this diversity, people have to explicitly employ different\narithmetics. To make a distinction, we call the conventional arithmetic by the\nname Diophantine arithmetic, while other arithmetics are called\nnon-Diophantine. There are two big families of non-Diophantine arithmetics:\nprojective arithmetics and dual arithmetics (Burgin, 1997). In this work, we\ngive an exposition of projective arithmetics, presenting their properties and\nconsidering also a more general mathematical structure called a projective\nprearithmetic.

We consider the opportunity cost of moving some cloud services to\nprivate, distributed, solar-powered computing facilities. To this end, we\ncompare the potential revenue of leasing computing resources to a cloud pool\nwith the revenue obtained by selling the surplus energy to the grid. We first\nestimate the consumption of virtualized cloud computing instances, establishing\na metric of computational efficiency per nominal photovoltaic power installed.\nBased on this metric and characterizing the site's annual solar production, we\nestimate the total return and payback. The results show that the model is\neconomically viable and technically feasible. We finally depict the still many\nquestions open, such as security, and the fundamental barriers to address,\nmainly related with a cloud model ruled by a few big players.\n"}

We present\nsimulations of the 21cm forest due to the large scale structure of the\nreionization-era IGM, including a prescription for x-ray heating and the\npercolation of photoionization bubbles. We show that, if detected with future\ninstruments such as the Square Kilometer Array (SKA), the 21cm forest can\nprovide a significant constraint on the thermal history of the IGM. Detection\nwill be aided by consideration of the sudden increase in signal variance at the\nonset of 21cm absorption. If radio foregrounds and the intrinsic source spectra\nare well understood, the flux decrement over wide bandwidths can also improve\ndetection prospects. Our analysis accounts for the possibility of narrow\nabsorption lines from intervening dense regions, but, unlike previous studies,\nour results do not depend on their properties. Assuming x-ray heating\ncorresponding to a local stellar population, we estimate that a statistically\nsignificant detection of 21cm absorption could be made by SKA in less than a\nyear of observing against a Cygnus A-type source at $z \\sim 9$, as opposed to\nnearly a decade for a significant detection of the detailed forest features. We\ndiscuss observational challenges due to uncertainties regarding the abundance\nof background sources and the strength of the 21cm absorption signal.\n"}

For accurate training of\ndeep neural networks, the learning data should be sufficient, of good quality,\nand should have a generalized property. However, in medical images, it is\ndifficult to acquire sufficient patient data because of the difficulty of\npatient recruitment, the burden of annotation of lesions by experts, and the\ninvasion of patients' privacy. In comparison, the medical images of healthy\nvolunteers can be easily acquired. Using healthy brain images, the proposed\nmethod synthesizes multi-contrast magnetic resonance images of brain tumors.\nBecause tumors have complex features, the proposed method simplifies them into\nconcentric circles that are easily controllable. Then it converts the\nconcentric circles into various realistic shapes of tumors through deep neural\nnetworks. Because numerous healthy brain images are easily available, our\nmethod can synthesize a huge number of the brain tumor images with various\nconcentric circles.

The allowed patterns are then those patterns avoiding the\nso-called forbidden root patterns and their shifted patterns. The second scope\nis to study forbidden patterns in shift systems, which are universal models in\ninformation theory, dynamical systems and stochastic processes. Due to its\nsimple structure, shift systems are accessible to a more detailed analysis and,\nat the same time, exhibit all important properties of low-dimensional chaotic\ndynamical systems (e.g., sensitivity to initial conditions, strong mixing and a\ndense set of periodic points), allowing to export the results to other\ndynamical systems via order-isomorphisms.\n"}

By this approximation, the spatial averaging scale of\nminisuperspace models is identified with an infrared scale (but not a regulator\nor cut-off) delimiting the modes included in the minisuperspace model. Some\nversions of the models studied here have discrete space or modifications of the\nHamiltonian expected from proposals of loop quantum gravity.

In robot contact tasks are often design to\nempirically look for force thresholds to define state transitions in a Markov\nchain or finite state machines. Such design is prone to failure in unstructured\nenvironments, when due to external disturbances or erroneous models, such\nthresholds are met, and lead to state transitions that are false-positives. The\nfocus of this paper is to perform high-level state estimation of robot\nbehaviors and task output for robot contact tasks.

Cartesian trajectories can be segmented and encoded in a way\nthat their dynamic properties, or \"texture\" are preserved.

It powers a compact tail-like X-ray pulsar\nwind nebula and X-ray-radio plerion associated with an extended TeV source HESS\nJ1356-645. We present our deep optical observations with the Very Large\nTelescope to search for an optical counterpart of the pulsar and its nebula. We\ndetect a point-like source in V, R, and I bands whose position is within the\n1-sigma error circle of the X-ray position of the pulsar, and whose colours are\ndistinct from those of ordinary stars. We consider it as a candidate optical\ncounterpart of the pulsar. If it is indeed the counterpart, its 5-sigma offset\nfrom the radio pulsar position, measured about 9 yr earlier, implies that the\ntransverse velocity of the pulsar is in the range of 1600--2000 km s^{-1} at\nthe distance of 2--2.5 kpc, making it the fastest moving pulsar known. The\ndirection of the estimated proper motion coincides with the extension of the\npulsar's X-ray tail, suggesting that this is a jet. The tentative optical\nluminosity and efficiency of the pulsar are similar to those of the Vela\npulsar, which also supports the optical identification. However, the candidate\nundergoes an unusually steep dereddened flux increase towards the infrared with\na spectral index of about 5, that is not typical of optical pulsars. It implies\na strong double-knee spectral break in the pulsar emission between the optical\nand X-rays. The reasons for the spectral steepness are unclear. It may be\ncaused by a nebula knot projected onto the jet and strongly overlapping with\nthe pulsar, as observed for the Crab, where the knot has a significantly\nsteeper spectrum than the pulsar. We find no other signs of the pulsar nebula\nin the optical. Alternatively, the detected source may be a faint AGN, that has\nnot yet been seen at other wavelengths.\n"}

In this\nmanner, one needs to perform only a few detailed experiments to obtain the\nnonequilibrium distribution function for the entire gamut of nonlinearity. We\nachieve this by maximizing the relative entropy functional (MaxRent), which is\nproportional to the Kullback-Leibler distance from a known density function,\nsubject to constraints supplied by the problem definition and new measurements.\nMaxRent is thus superior to the principle of maximum entropy (MaxEnt), which\nmaximizes Shannon's informational entropy for estimating distributions but\nlacks the ability of incorporating additional prior information. The MaxRent\nprinciple is illustrated using a toy model of $\\phi^4$ thermal conduction\nconsisting of a single lattice point. An external protocol controlled\nposition-dependent temperature field drives the system out of equilibrium. Two\ndifferent thermostatting schemes are employed: the Hoover-Holian deterministic\nthermostat (which produces multifractal dynamics under strong nonlinearity) and\nthe Langevin stochastic thermostat (which produces phase space-filling\ndynamics). Out of the 80 possible states produced by the protocol, we assume\nthat 4 states are known to us in detail, one of which is used as input into\nMaxRent at a time. We find that MaxRent accurately approximates the phase space\ndensity functions at all values of the protocol even when the known\ndistribution is far away. MaxEnt, however, is unable to capture the fine\ndetails of the phase space distribution functions. We expect this method to be\nuseful in other external protocol driven nonequilibrium cases as well.\n"}

The Lagrangian of\nK-essence kind modified gravity is made up of the three dimensional Ricci\nscalar and an arbitrary function of the extrinsic curvature term. We find the\ncosmic acceleration can also be naturally interpreted without invoking any kind\nof dark energy. The static, spherically symmetry and vacuum solutions of both\ntheories are Schwarzschild or Schwarzschild-de Sitter solution.

{"title": "Structural and electronic properties of V2O5 and their tuning by doping\n  with 3d elements - Modelling with DFT+U method and dispersion correction", "trgt": "  New electrode materials for alkaline-ion batteries are a timely topic. Among\nmany promising candidates, V2O5 is one of the most interesting cathode\nmaterials. While having very high theoretical capacity, in practice, its\nperformance is hindered by low stability and poor conductivity. As regards\ntheoretical descriptions of V2O5, common DFT-GGA calculations fail to reproduce\nboth the electronic and crystal structure. While the band gap is\nunderestimated, the interlayer spacing is overestimated as weak dispersion\ninteractions are not properly described within GGA. Here we show that the\ncombination of the DFT+U method and semi-empirical D2 correction can compensate\nfor the drawbacks of the GGA approximation when it comes to the modelling of\nV2O5. When compared to common PBE calculations, with a modest increase of the\ncomputational cost, PBE+U+D2 fully reproduced the experimental band gap of\nV2O5, while the errors in the lattice parameters are only a few percent. Using\nthe proposed PBE+U+D2 methodology we studied V2O5 doped with 3d elements (from\nSc to Zn). We show that both the structural and electronic parameters are\naffected by doping. Most importantly, a significant increase of conductivity is\nexpected upon doping, which is of great importance for the application of V2O5\nin metal-ion batteries.\n"}

They invited\ncomparisons with major works of the epic tradition, including Homer's Iliad and\nOdyssey, and effected a profound influence on the emergent Romantic period in\nliterature and the arts. However, the work also provoked one of the most famous\nliterary controversies of all time, colouring the reception of the poetry to\nthis day. The authenticity of the poems was questioned by some scholars, while\nothers protested that they misappropriated material from Irish mythological\nsources. Recent years have seen a growing critical interest in Ossian,\ninitiated by revisionist and counter-revisionist scholarship and by the\ntwo-hundred-and-fiftieth anniversary of the first collected edition of the\npoems in 1765. Here we investigate Ossian from a networks-science point of\nview. We compare the connectivity structures underlying the societies described\nin the Ossianic narratives with those of ancient Greek and Irish sources.\nDespite attempts, from the outset, to position Ossian alongside the Homeric\nepics and to distance it from Irish sources, our results indicate significant\nnetwork-structural differences between Macpherson's text and those of Homer.\nThey also show a strong similarity between Ossianic networks and those of the\nnarratives known as Acallam na Sen\\'orach (Colloquy of the Ancients) from the\nFenian Cycle of Irish mythology.\n"}

The unified picture\nthat emerges from our analysis is that the main physical drivers shaping the\ndistribution of matter at all scales are star formation-driven galactic\noutflows at $z>2$ for lower mass halos and AGN jets at $z<2$ in higher mass\nhalos. Feedback suppresses the baryon mass function with time relative to the\nhalo mass function, and it even impacts the halo mass function itself at the\n~20% level, particularly evacuating the centres and enhancing dark matter just\noutside halos. At early epochs baryons pile up in the centres of halos, but by\nlate epochs and particularly in massive systems gas has mostly been evacuated\nfrom within the inner halo.

In particular, we study how the measured\nproperties of subhaloes vary as a function of the parent halo mass, the\nphysical properties of the parent halo, and redshift. The fraction of halo mass\nin substructures increases with increasing mass. There is, however, a very\nlarge halo-to-halo scatter that can be explained only in part by a range of\nhalo physical properties, e.g. concentration. At given halo mass, less\nconcentrated haloes contain significantly larger fractions of mass in\nsubstructures because of the reduced strength of tidal disruption. Most of the\nsubstructure mass is located at the outskirts of the parent haloes, in\nrelatively few massive subhaloes. This mass segregation appears to become\nstronger at increasing redshift, and should reflect into a more significant\nmass segregation of the galaxy population at different cosmic epochs. When\nhaloes are accreted onto larger structures, their mass is significantly reduced\nby tidal stripping. Haloes that are more massive at the time of accretion\n(these should host more luminous galaxies) are brought closer to the centre on\nshorter time-scales by dynamical friction, and therefore suffer of a more\nsignificant stripping. The halo merger rate depends strongly on the environment\nwith substructure in more massive haloes suffering more important mergers than\ntheir counterparts residing in less massive systems.

Compelling $\\textit{in vitro}$ data demonstrated that strontium\nhydroxyapatite nanoparticles exert a dual action, by promoting\nosteoblasts-driven matrix secretion and inhibiting osteoclasts-driven matrix\nresorption. Recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein 2 (rhBMP2) is a\npowerful osteoinductive biologic, used for the treatment of vertebral fractures\nand critically-sized bone defects.

Taurus's rich observational history has uncovered\npeculiarities that suggest a complicated star forming event, such as members at\nlarge distances from the molecular clouds and evidence of an age spread. With\nGaia, an in-depth study of the Taurus census is possible to confirm membership,\nidentify substructure, and reconstruct its star formation history. We have\ncompiled an expansive census of the greater Taurus region, identifying spatial\nsubgroups and confirming that Taurus is substructured across stellar density.\nThere are two populations of subgroups: clustered groups near the clouds and\nsparse groups spread throughout the region. The sparse groups comprise Taurus's\ndistributed population, which is on average older than the population near the\nclouds, and hosts sub-populations up to 15 Myr old. The ages of the clustered\ngroups increase with distance, suggesting that the current star formation was\ntriggered from behind. Still, the region is kinematically coherent, and its\nvelocity structure reflects an initial turbulent spectrum similar to Larson's\nLaw that has been modified by dynamical relaxation. Overall, Taurus has a\ncomplicated star formation history, with at least two epochs of star formation\nfeaturing both clustered and distributed modes. Given the correlations between\nage and spatial distribution, Taurus might be part of a galaxy-scale star\nforming event that can only begin to be understood in the Gaia era.\n"}

We present numerical\nsimulations of the effect of baryonic mass loss on the structure of a\nspheroidal stellar system, embedded in a dark matter halo. This process,\ninvoked as a possible explanation of the observed size increase of ETGs since z\n\\sim 2, could be caused either by QSO/starburst driven galactic winds, promptly\nejecting from Early Type Galaxies (ETGs) the residual gas and halting star\nformation (galactic winds), or by stellar mass returned to the ISM in the final\nstages of stellar evolution. Indeed, we find that a conceivable loss of about\n50% of the baryonic mass can produce a significant size increase. However, the\npuffing up due to galactic winds occurs when the stellar populations are much\nyounger than the estimated ages >0.5 Gyr of compact high-z ETGs. Therefore,\nwhile it may have had a role in deciding the final structure of ETGs, it cannot\nexplain the evolution observed so far of their size-mass relation; its\nsignature should be searched for in much younger systems. Conversely, the mass\nloss due to stellar evolution could cause a relatively modest expansion of\npassively evolving stellar systems later on, contributing to, without\ndominating, the observed evolution of their mass-size relationship.\n"}

For the strong user, we show that NOMA achieves a\nhigher EC than OMA at small values of the transmit SNR and that at high values\nof the transmit SNR OMA becomes more beneficial. By introducing user pairing\nwhen more than two NOMA users are present, we show that NOMA with user pairing\noutperforms OMA in term of the total link layer EC.

This property of 3D models can dramatically affect\nelemental abundances derived from temperature-sensitive spectral lines. We\ninvestigate whether the cool surface temperatures predicted by metal-poor 3D\nmodels can be ascribed to the approximated treatment of scattering in the\nradiative transfer. We use the Bifrost code to test three different ways to\nhandle scattering in 3D model atmospheres of metal-poor stars. First, we solve\nself-consistently the radiative transfer equation for a source function with a\ncoherent scattering term. Second, we solve the radiative transfer equation for\na Planckian source function, neglecting the contribution of continuum\nscattering to extinction in the optically thin layers; this has been the\ndefault mode in previous models of ours. Third, we treat scattering as pure\nabsorption everywhere, which is the standard case in CO5BOLD models. We find\nthat the second approach produces temperature structures with cool upper\nphotospheric layers very similar to the correct coherent scattering solution.\nIn contrast, treating scattering as pure absorption leads to significantly\nhotter and shallower temperature stratifications. The main differences in\ntemperature structure between our published models and those generated with the\nCO5BOLD code can be traced to the different treatments of scattering.\nNeglecting the contribution of continuum scattering to extinction in optically\nthin layers provides a good approximation to the full radiative transfer\nsolution for metal-poor stars.

The mechanism exploits local\nnonadiabatic effects at a conical intersection, turning them from a decoherence\nsource into an asset. The conical intersection is a consequence of the exciton\npulses moving along a linear Rydberg chain and approaching an additional\nlinear, perpendicularly aligned Rydberg chain. The intersection provides a\nsensitive knob controlling the propagation direction and coherence properties\nof exciton pulses.\n  We demonstrate that this scenario can be exploited as an exciton switch,\ncontrolling direction and coherence properties of the joint pulse on the second\nof the chains. Initially, we demonstrate the pulse splitting on planar\naggregates with atomic motion one-dimensionally constrained and employing\nisotropic interactions. Subsequently, we confirm the splitting mechanism for a\nfully realistic scenario in which all spatial restrictions are removed and the\nfull anisotropy of the dipole-dipole interactions is taken into account.

The uncertainty on the ^14N+p ->\n^15O+g rate is the largest of the non-composition uncertainties to the CNO\nneutrino fluxes. We propose an independent method to help identify which SSM is\nthe correct one.

From\nfirst-principles electronic-structure results, we find that the\n\\emph{antiferro-quadrupolar} (AFQ) ordering in CeB$_{6}$ arises from\ncrystal-field splitting and yields band structure in agreement with\nexperiments. With interactions of $p$-electrons between Ce and B$_{6}$ being\nsmall, the electronic state of CeB$_{6}$ is suitably described as\nCe(4$f^{1}$)$^{3+}$(e$^{-}$)(B$_{6}$)$^{2-}$. The AFQ state of orbital spins is\ncaused by an exchange interaction induced through spin-orbit interaction, which\nalso splits J=5/2 state into $\\Gamma_{8}$ ground state and $\\Gamma_{7}$ excited\nstate. Within the smallest antiferromagnetic (111) configuration, an\norbital-ordered AFQ state appears during charge self-consistency, and supports\nthe appearance of `hidden' order. Hydrostatic pressure (either applied or\nchemically induced) stabilizes the AFM (AFQ) states over a ferromagnetic one,\nas observed at low temperatures.\n"}
{"title": "Dirac states with knobs on: interplay of external parameters and the\n  surface electronic properties of 3D topological insulators", "trgt": "  Topological insulators are a novel materials platform with high applications\npotential in fields ranging from spintronics to quantum computation. In the\nongoing scientific effort to demonstrate controlled manipulation of their\nelectronic structure by external means, stoichiometric variation and surface\ndecoration are two effective approaches that have been followed. In ARPES\nexperiments, both approaches are seen to lead to electronic band structure\nchanges. Such approaches result in variations of the energy position of bulk\nand surface-related features and the creation of two-dimensional electron\ngases.The data presented here demonstrate that a third manipulation handle is\naccessible by utilizing the amount of illumination a topological insulator\nsurface has been exposed to under typical experimental ARPES conditions. Our\nresults show that this new, third, knob acts on an equal footing with\nstoichiometry and surface decoration as a modifier of the electronic band\nstructure, and that it is in continuous competition with the latter. The data\nclearly point towards surface photovoltage and photo-induced desorption as the\nphysical phenomena behind modifications of the electronic band structure under\nexposure to high-flux photons. We show that the interplay of these phenomena\ncan minimize and even eliminate the adsorbate-related surface band bending on\ntypical binary, ternary and quaternary Bi-based topological insulators.\nIncluding the influence of the sample temperature, these data set up a\nframework for the external control of the electronic band structure in\ntopological insulator compounds in an ARPES setting. Four external knobs are\navailable: bulk stoichiometry, surface decoration, temperature and photon\nexposure. These knobs can be used in conjunction to tune the band energies near\nthe surface and consequently influence the topological properties of the\nrelevant electronic states.\n"}
{"title": "Centrality anomalies in complex networks as a result of model\n  over-simplification", "trgt": "  Tremendous advances have been made in our understanding of the properties and\nevolution of complex networks. These advances were initially driven by\ninformation-poor empirical networks and theoretical analysis of unweighted and\nundirected graphs. Recently, information-rich empirical data complex networks\nsupported the development of more sophisticated models that include edge\ndirectionality and weight properties, and multiple layers. Many studies still\nfocus on unweighted undirected description of networks, prompting an essential\nquestion: how to identify when a model is simpler than it must be? Here, we\nargue that the presence of centrality anomalies in complex networks is a result\nof model over-simplification. Specifically, we investigate the well-known\nanomaly in betweenness centrality for transportation networks, according to\nwhich highly connected nodes are not necessarily the most central. Using a\nbroad class of network models with weights and spatial constraints and four\nlarge data sets of transportation networks, we show that the unweighted\nprojection of the structure of these networks can exhibit a significant\nfraction of anomalous nodes compared to a random null model. However, the\nweighted projection of these networks, compared with an appropriated null\nmodel, significantly reduces the fraction of anomalies observed, suggesting\nthat centrality anomalies are a symptom of model over-simplification. Because\nlack of information-rich data is a common challenge when dealing with complex\nnetworks and can cause anomalies that misestimate the role of nodes in the\nsystem, we argue that sufficiently sophisticated models be used when anomalies\nare detected.\n"}

In this work, we aim to derive the\nfundamental parameters of a close triple star system, HD 188753, for which\nasteroseismic and astrometric observations allow independent measurements of\nstellar masses. We used six months of Kepler photometry available for HD 188753\nto detect the oscillation envelopes of the two brightest stars.

We then derived initial guesses\nof the stellar masses and ages based on two seismic parameters and on a\ncharacteristic frequency ratio, and modelled the two components independently\nwith the stellar evolution code CESTAM. In addition, we derived the masses of\nthe three stars by applying a Bayesian analysis to the position and\nradial-velocity measurements of the system. Based on stellar modelling, the\nmean common age of the system is $10.8 \\pm 0.2\\,$Gyr and the masses of the two\nseismic components are $M_A =$ $0.99 \\pm 0.01\\,M_\\odot$ and $M_{Ba} =$ $0.86\n\\pm 0.01\\,M_\\odot$.

{"title": "Physical Mechanism for the Intermediate Characteristic Stellar Mass in\n  the Extremely Metal-poor Environments", "trgt": "  If a significant fraction of metals is in dust, star-forming cores with\nmetallicity higher than a critical value ~10^{-6}-10^{-5}Z_sun are able to\nfragment by dust cooling, thereby producing low-mass cores. Despite being above\nthe critical metallicity, a metallicity range is found to exist around\n10^{-5}-10^{-4}Z_sun where low-mass fragmentation is prohibited. In this range,\nthree-body H_2 formation starts at low (~100K) temperature and thus the\nresulting heating causes a dramatic temperature jump, which makes the central\npart of the star-forming core transiently hydrostatic and thus highly\nspherical. With little elongation, the core does not experience fragmentation\nin the subsequent dust-cooling phase. The minimum fragmentation mass is set by\nthe Jeans mass just before the H_2 formation heating, and its value can be as\nhigh as ~10M_sun. For metallicity higher than ~10^{-4}Z_sun, H_2 formation is\nalmost completed by the dust-surface reaction before the onset of the\nthree-body reaction, and low-mass star formation becomes possible. This\nmechanism might explain the higher characteristic mass of metal-poor stars than\nin the solar neighborhood presumed from the statistics of carbon-enhanced\nstars.\n"}

These two features would seem\nto be quite unrelated in that the loops are near their minimum-energy\ncurrent-free state, whereas filaments are regions of high magnetic stress and\nintense electric currents. We argue that, in fact, these two features are\ninextricably linked in that both are due to a single process: the injection of\nmagnetic helicity into the corona by photospheric motions and the subsequent\nevolution of this helicity by coronal reconnection. In this paper, we present\nnumerical simulations of the response of a \\citet{Parker72} corona to\nphotospheric driving motions that have varying degrees of helicity preference.\nWe obtain four main conclusions: 1) in agreement with the helicity condensation\nmodel of \\citet{Antiochos13}, the inverse cascade of helicity by magnetic\nreconnection results in the formation of prominences/filaments localized about\npolarity inversion lines (PILs); 2) this same process removes most structure\nfrom the rest of the corona, resulting in smooth and laminar coronal loops; 3)\nthe amount of remnant tangling in coronal loops is inversely dependent on the\nnet helicity injected by the driving motions; and 4) the structure of the solar\ncorona depends only on the helicity preference of the driving motions and not\non their detailed time dependence.

A large number of parameters that influence the water line emission\nare explored: luminosity, density,density slope and water abundances.Both dust\nand water emission are modelled using full radiative transfer in spherical\nsymmetry. The temperature profile is calculated for a given density profile.\nThe H2O level populations and emission profiles are in turn computed with a\nnon-LTE line code. The results are analyzed to determine the diagnostic value\nof different lines, and are compared with existing observations. Lines can be\ncategorized in: (i) optically thick lines, including ground-state lines, mostly\nsensitive to the cold outer part; (ii) highly excited (E_u>200-250 K) optically\nthin lines sensitive to the abundance in the hot inner part; and (iii) lines\nwhich vary from optically thick to thin depending on the abundances. Dust\ninfluences the emission of water significantly by becoming optically thick at\nthe higher frequencies, and by pumping optically thin lines. A good physical\nmodel of a source, including a correct treatment of dust, is a prerequisite to\ninfer the water abundance structure and possible jumps at the evaporation\ntemperature from observations. The inner warm (T>100 K) envelope can be probed\nbyhighly-excited lines, while a combination of excited and spectrally resolved\nground state lines probes the outer envelope. Observations of H218O lines,\nalthough weak, provide even stronger constraints on abundances.\n"}

{"title": "Neighborhoods of Analytic Varieties in Complex Manifolds", "trgt": "  The systematic study of neighborhoods of analytic varieties was started by H.\nGrauert in his celebrated article 1962. In that article he considers a manifold\nX and a negatively embedded submanifold A subset X. He introduces\nn-neighborhood, n in N, of A and studies when an isomorphism of two\nn-neighborhoods can be extended to an isomorphism of (n+1)-neighborhoods. He\nobserves that obstructions to this extension problem lie in the first\ncohomology group of certain sheaves involving the normal bundle of A in X.\nUsing a version of Kodaira vanishing theorem he shows that for a large n these\ncohomology groups vanish and so he concludes that the germ of a negatively\nembedded manifold A depends only on a finite neighborhood of it. These methods\nare generalized to a germ of an arbitrary negatively embedded divisor A by\nHironaka, Rossi and Laufer. In the case where A is a Riemann surface embedded\nin a two dimensional manifold, by using Serre duality we can say exactly which\nfinite neighborhood of A determines the embedding.\n  This isa first draft of an expository article about negatively embedded\nvarieties. The text is mainly based on Grauert's paper, but we have used also\nthe contributions of subsequent authors; for instance the Artin's criterion on\nthe existence of convergent solutions is used instead of Grauert's geometrical\nmethods. Our principal aim is to extend this study to the germ of foliated\nneighborhoods and singularities. In the first steps we will consider the most\nsimple foliations which are transversal foliations.

Using available supernova-analysis tools we find that there\nare several conditions in which a viable distance-redshift can be determined.\nUncertainties in the effective distance at z~0.3 are dominated by redshift\nuncertainties coupled with the steepness of the Hubble law.

{"title": "A scalable computational framework for establishing long-term behavior\n  of stochastic reaction networks", "trgt": "  Reaction networks are systems in which the populations of a finite number of\nspecies evolve through predefined interactions. Such networks are found as\nmodeling tools in many biological disciplines such as biochemistry, ecology,\nepidemiology, immunology, systems biology and synthetic biology. It is now\nwell-established that, for small population sizes, stochastic models for\nbiochemical reaction networks are necessary to capture randomness in the\ninteractions. The tools for analyzing such models, however, still lag far\nbehind their deterministic counterparts. In this paper, we bridge this gap by\ndeveloping a constructive framework for examining the long-term behavior and\nstability properties of the reaction dynamics in a stochastic setting. In\nparticular, we address the problems of determining ergodicity of the reaction\ndynamics, which is analogous to having a globally attracting fixed point for\ndeterministic dynamics. We also examine when the statistical moments of the\nunderlying process remain bounded with time and when they converge to their\nsteady state values. The framework we develop relies on a blend of ideas from\nprobability theory, linear algebra and optimization theory. We demonstrate that\nthe stability properties of a wide class of biological networks can be assessed\nfrom our sufficient theoretical conditions that can be recast as efficient and\nscalable linear programs, well-known for their tractability. It is notably\nshown that the computational complexity is often linear in the number of\nspecies. We illustrate the validity, the efficiency and the wide applicability\nof our results on several reaction networks arising in biochemistry, systems\nbiology, epidemiology and ecology. The biological implications of the results\nas well as an example of a non-ergodic biological network are also discussed.\n"}

A strong step\nbunching instability takes place when the kinetic length is larger than the\naverage distance between the steps on the vicinal surface. In the opposite\nlimit the instability is weak and step bunching can occur only when the\nmagnitude of step-step repulsion is small. The central result are power law\nrelations of the between the width, the height, and the minimum interstep\ndistance of a bunch. These relations are obtained from a continuum evolution\nequation for the surface profile, which is derived from the discrete step\ndynamical equations for. The analysis of the continuum equation reveals the\nexistence of two types of stationary bunch profiles with different scaling\nproperties. Through a mathematical equivalence on the level of the discrete\nstep equations as well as on the continuum level, our results carry over to the\nproblems of step bunching induced by growth with a strong inverse ES effect,\nand by electromigration in the attachment/detachment limited regime. Thus our\nwork provides support for the existence of universality classes of step\nbunching instabilities [A. Pimpinelli et al., Phys. Rev.

{"title": "Performance Characterization of Image Feature Detectors in Relation to\n  the Scene Content Utilizing a Large Image Database", "trgt": "  Selecting the most suitable local invariant feature detector for a particular\napplication has rendered the task of evaluating feature detectors a critical\nissue in vision research. No state-of-the-art image feature detector works\nsatisfactorily under all types of image transformations. Although the\nliterature offers a variety of comparison works focusing on performance\nevaluation of image feature detectors under several types of image\ntransformation, the influence of the scene content on the performance of local\nfeature detectors has received little attention so far. This paper aims to\nbridge this gap with a new framework for determining the type of scenes, which\nmaximize and minimize the performance of detectors in terms of repeatability\nrate. Several state-of-the-art feature detectors have been assessed utilizing a\nlarge database of 12936 images generated by applying uniform light and blur\nchanges to 539 scenes captured from the real world.

{"title": "False discovery rate control under reduced precision computation for\n  analysis of neuroimaging data", "trgt": "  The mitigation of false positives is an important issue when conducting\nmultiple hypothesis testing. The most popular paradigm for false positives\nmitigation in high-dimensional applications is via the control of the false\ndiscovery rate (FDR). Multiple testing data from neuroimaging experiments can\nbe very large, and reduced precision storage of such data is often required.\nReduced precision computation is often a problem in the analysis of legacy data\nand data arising from legacy pipelines. We present a method for FDR control\nthat is applicable in cases where only p\\text{-values} or test statistics (with\ncommon and known null distribution) are available, and when those\np\\text{-values} or test statistics are encoded in a reduced precision format.\nOur method is based on an empirical-Bayes paradigm where the probit\ntransformation of the p\\text{-values} (called the z\\text{-scores}) are modeled\nas a two-component mixture of normal distributions. Due to the reduced\nprecision of the p\\text{-values} or test statistics, the usual approach for\nfitting mixture models may not be feasible. We instead use a binned-data\ntechnique, which can be proved to consistently estimate the z\\text{-score}\ndistribution parameters under mild correlation assumptions, as is often the\ncase in neuroimaging data. A simulation study shows that our methodology is\ncompetitive when compared with popular alternatives, especially with data in\nthe presence of misspecification. We demonstrate the applicability of our\nmethodology in practice via a brain imaging study of mice.\n"}
{"title": "Scattering of EM waves by many small perfectly conducting or impedance\n  bodies", "trgt": "  A theory of electromagnetic (EM) wave scattering by many small particles of\nan arbitrary shape is developed. The particles are perfectly conducting or\nimpedance. For a small impedance particle of an arbitrary shape an explicit\nanalytical formula is derived for the scattering amplitude. The formula holds\nas $a\\to 0$, where $a$ is a characteristic size of the small particle and the\nwavelength is arbitrary but fixed. The scattering amplitude for a small\nimpedance particle is shown to be proportional to $a^{2-\\kappa}$, where\n$\\kappa\\in [0,1)$ is a parameter which can be chosen by an experimenter as\nhe/she wants. The boundary impedance of a small particle is assumed to be of\nthe form $\\zeta=ha^{-\\kappa}$, where $h=$const, Re$h\\ge 0$. The scattering\namplitude for a small perfectly conducting particle is proportional to $a^3$,\nit is much smaller than that for the small impedance particle. The many-body\nscattering problem is solved under the physical assumptions $a\\ll d\\ll\n\\lambda$, where $d$ is the minimal distance between neighboring particles and\n$\\lambda$ is the wavelength. The distribution law for the small impedance\nparticles is $\\mathcal{N}(\\delta)\\sim\\int_{\\delta}N(x)dx$ as $a\\to 0$. Here\n$N(x)\\ge 0$ is an arbitrary continuous function that can be chosen by the\nexperimenter and $\\mathcal{N}(\\delta)$ is the number of particles in an\narbitrary sub-domain $\\Delta$. It is proved that the EM field in the medium\nwhere many small particles, impedance or perfectly conducting, are distributed,\nhas a limit, as $a\\to 0$ and a differential equation is derived for the\nlimiting field. On this basis the recipe is given for creating materials with a\ndesired refraction coefficient by embedding many small impedance particles into\na given material.\n"}

{"title": "Star Formation and Feedback in Dwarf Galaxies", "trgt": "  We examine the star formation history and stellar feedback effects of dwarf\ngalaxies under the influence of extragalactic ultraviolet radiation. We\nconsider the dynamical evolution of gas in dwarf galaxies using a\none-dimensional, spherically symmetric, Lagrangian numerical scheme to compute\nthe effects of radiative transfer and photoionization. We include a\nphysically-motivated star formation recipe and consider the effects of\nfeedback. Our results indicate that star formation in the severe environment of\ndwarf galaxies is a difficult and inefficient process. For intermediate mass\nsystems, such as the dSphs around the Galaxy, star formation can proceed with\nin early cosmic epochs despite the intense background UV flux. Triggering\nprocesses such as merger events, collisions, and tidal disturbance can lead to\ndensity enhancements, reducing the recombination timescale, allowing gas to\ncool and star formation to proceed. However, the star formation and gas\nretention efficiency may vary widely in galaxies with similar dark matter\npotentials, because they depend on many factors, such as the baryonic fraction,\nexternal perturbation, IMF, and background UV intensity. We suggest that the\npresence of very old stars in these dwarf galaxies indicates that their initial\nbaryonic to dark matter content was comparable to the cosmic value. This\nconstraint suggests that the initial density fluctuation of baryonic matter may\nbe correlated with that of the dark matter. For the more massive dwarf\nelliptical galaxies, the star formation efficiency and gas retention rate is\nmuch higher. Their mass to light ratio is regulated by star formation feedback,\nand is expected to be nearly independent of their absolute luminosity. The\nresults of our theoretical models reproduce the observed $M/L-M_v$ correlation.\n"}

The Halpha\nline is strongly contaminated by the emission of the envelope, therefore for\nconsideration of accretion disc properties we use the Hgamma line. The Halpha\nline had broad wings which are supposed to be determined mostly from radiation\ndamping but high velocity stellar wind from the compact object in the system\ncan also contribute to their appearance.

In such a coannihilation mechanism the\nstau mass usually has an upper bound since its annihilation rate becomes small\nwith the increase of DM mass. Inspired by this observation, we examine the\nupper limit of stau mass in the parameter space with a large mixing of staus.\nWe find that the stau pair may dominantly annihilate into dibosons and hence\nthe upper bound on the stau mass ($\\sim400$ GeV) obtained from the $f\\bar{f}$\nfinal states can be relaxed. Imposing the DM relic density constraint and\nrequiring a long lifetime of the present vacuum, we find that the lighter stau\nmass can be as heavy as about 1.4 TeV for the stau maximum mixing. However, if\nrequiring the present vacuum to survive during the thermal history of the\nuniverse, this mass limit will reduce to about 0.9 TeV. We also discuss the\ncomplementarity of vacuum stability and direct detections in probing this stau\ncoannihilation scenario.\n"}

This implies that when $n>n^*(s, d, b)$ the convergence\nrate does not depend on the ambient dimension $d$ and is the same as knowing\nthe support of the distribution beforehand.\n  We next ask the question: ``what is the minimum $n^*(s, d, b)$ that allows\ndimension-free convergence?''. To upper bound $n^*(s, d, b)$, we develop novel\nlocalization schemes to accurately and efficiently localize the unknown\nsupport.

Following the innovative\nidea recently proposed in \\cite{Dumbser2014}, the discrete solution within the\ntroubled cells is \\textit{recomputed} by scattering the DG polynomial at the\nprevious time step onto a suitable number of sub-cells along each direction.\nRelying on the robustness of classical finite volume WENO schemes, the sub-cell\naverages are recomputed and then gathered back into the DG polynomials over the\nmain grid.

On these planets, the sub-stellar hemisphere\nexperiences perpetual daylight while the opposing anti-stellar hemisphere\nexperiences perpetual darkness. Because the night-side hemisphere has no direct\nsource of energy, the air over this side of the planet is prone to freeze out\nand deposit on the surface, which could result in atmospheric collapse.\nHowever, general circulation models (GCMs) have shown that atmospheric dynamics\ncan counteract this problem and provide sufficient energy transport to the\nanti-stellar side.\n  Here we use an idealized GCM to consider the impact of geothermal heating on\nthe habitability of synchronously rotating planets. Geothermal heating may be\nexpected due to tidal interactions with the host star, and the effects of\ngeothermal heating provide additional habitable surface area and may help to\ninduce melting of ice on the anti-stellar hemisphere. We also explore the\npersistence of atmospheric asymmetries between the northern and southern\nhemispheres, and we find that the direction of the meridional circulation (for\nrapidly rotating planets) or the direction of zonal wind (for slowly rotating\nplanets) reverses on either side of the sub-stellar point.

Formally, given a\ndirected graph, we want to partition vertices into levels such that ideally\nthere are only edges from upper levels to lower levels. From computational\npoint of view, the ideal case is when the underlying directed graph is acyclic.\nIn such case, we can partition the vertices into a hierarchy such that there\nare only edges from upper levels to lower edges.

{"title": "Functional Registration and Local Variations: Identifiability, Rank, and\n  Tuning", "trgt": "  We develop theory and methodology for the problem of nonparametric\nregistration of functional data that have been subjected to random deformation\n(warping) of their time scale. The separation of this phase variation\n(\"horizontal\" variation) from the amplitude variation (\"vertical\" variation) is\ncrucial in order to properly conduct further analyses, which otherwise can be\nseverely distorted. We determine precise nonparametric conditions under which\nthe two forms of variation are identifiable. These show that the\nidentifiability delicately depends on the underlying rank. By means of several\ncounterexamples, we demonstrate that our conditions are sharp if one wishes a\ngenuinely nonparametric setup; and in doing so we caution that popular remedies\nsuch as structural assumptions or roughness penalties can easily fail. We then\npropose a nonparametric registration method based on a \"local variation\nmeasure\", the main element in elucidating identifiability. A key advantage of\nthe method is that it is free of any tuning or penalisation parameters\nregulating the amount of alignment, thus circumventing the problem of\nover/under-registration often encountered in practice. We provide asymptotic\ntheory for the resulting estimators under the identifiable regime, but also\nunder mild departures from identifiability, quantifying the resulting bias in\nterms of the amplitude variation's spectral gap.\n"}

NGC 2419 is one of the best Galactic\nglobular clusters for such a study due to its long relaxation time (T_{r0} ~\n10^{10} yr) and large Galactocentric distance (R_{GC} ~ 90 kpc) -- properties\nthat make significant evolutionary changes in the low-mass end of the cluster\nmass function unlikely. We find a mean cluster velocity of <v_r>=-20.3 +- 0.7\nkm/sec and an internal velocity dispersion of \\sigma = 4.14 +- 0.48 km/sec,\nleading to a total mass of (9.0 +- 2.2) * 10^5 Msun and a global mass-to-light\nratio of M/L_V = 2.05 +- 0.50 in solar units.

{"title": "Regional Priority Based Anomaly Detection using Autoencoders", "trgt": "  In the recent times, autoencoders, besides being used for compression, have\nbeen proven quite useful even for regenerating similar images or help in image\ndenoising. They have also been explored for anomaly detection in a few cases.\nHowever, due to location invariance property of convolutional neural network,\nautoencoders tend to learn from or search for learned features in the complete\nimage. This creates issues when all the items in the image are not equally\nimportant and their location matters. For such cases, a semi supervised\nsolution - regional priority based autoencoder (RPAE) has been proposed. In\nthis model, similar to object detection models, a region proposal network\nidentifies the relevant areas in the images as belonging to one of the\npredefined categories and then those bounding boxes are fed into appropriate\ndecoder based on the category they belong to. Finally, the error scores from\nall the decoders are combined based on their importance to provide total\nreconstruction error.\n"}

The detector geometry and\nrequired density of instrumentation are discussed along with the requirements\nto control the various sources of background, such as solar neutrinos. In\nparticular, the suppression of spallation events induced by atmospheric muons\nposes a challenge that will need to be addressed. Assuming this background can\nbe controlled, we find that the resulting detector will be able to detect SNe\nfrom beyond 10 Mpc, delivering between 10 and 41 regular core-collapse SN\ndetections per decade. It would further allow to study more speculative\nphenomena, such as optically dark (failed) SNe, where the collapse proceeds\ndirectly to a black hole, at a detection rate similar to that of regular SNe.\nWe find that the biggest technological challenge lies in the required number of\nlarge area photo-sensors, with simultaneous strict limits on the allowed noise\nrates. If both can be realized, the detector concept we present will reach the\nrequired sensitivity with a comparatively small construction effort and hence\noffers a route to future routine observations of SNe with neutrinos.\n"}

State-of-the-art approaches to multi-source early\nPSD estimation, given an estimate of the associated relative early transfer\nfunctions (RETFs), conventionally minimize the approximation error defined with\nrespect to the early correlation matrix, requiring non-negative inequality\nconstraints on the PSDs. Instead, we here propose to factorize the early\ncorrelation matrix and minimize the approximation error defined with respect to\nthe early-correlation-matrix square root. The proposed minimization problem --\nconstituting a generalization of the so-called orthogonal Procrustes problem --\nseeks a unitary matrix and the square roots of the early PSDs up to an\narbitrary complex argument, making non-negative inequality constraints\nredundant. A solution is obtained iteratively, requiring one singular value\ndecomposition (SVD) per iteration. The estimated unitary matrix and early PSD\nsquare roots further allow to recursively update the RETF estimate, which is\nnot inherently possible in the conventional approach. An estimate of the said\nearly-correlation-matrix square root itself is obtained by means of the\ngeneralized eigenvalue decomposition (GEVD), where we further propose to\nrestore non-stationarities by desmoothing the generalized eigenvalues in order\nto compensate for inevitable recursive averaging.

Our model consists of a system of differential-algebraic equations\nwhich allows for supersaturation and comprises intrinsic automated droplet\nactivation due to a coupling of the droplet mass- and number concentrations\ntailored to this problem. For the numerical solution of this system we\nrecommend a semi-implicit integration scheme, with efficient solvers for the\nimplicit parts. The new model shows encouraging numerical results when compared\nwith alternative cloud parameterizations, and it is well suited to investigate\nmodel uncertainties and to quantify predictability of weather events in moist\natmospheric regimes.\n"}
{"title": "The ACCELERATION programme: I. Cosmology with the redshift drift", "trgt": "  Detecting the change of a cosmological object's redshift due to the time\nevolution of the Universal expansion rate is an ambitious experiment that will\nbe attempted with future telescope facilities. In this paper, we describe the\nACCELERATION programme, which aims to study the properties of the most\nunderdense regions of the Universe. One of the highlight goals of this\nprogramme is to prepare for the redshift drift measurement. Using the EAGLE\ncosmological hydrodynamic simulations, we estimate the peculiar acceleration of\ngas in galaxies and in the Lya forest. We find that star-forming 'cold neutral\ngas' exhibits large peculiar acceleration due to the high local density of\nbaryons near star-forming regions. We conclude that absorption by cold neutral\ngas is unlikely to yield a detection of the cosmological redshift drift. On the\nother hand, we find that the peculiar accelerations of Lya forest absorbers are\nmore than an order of magnitude below the expected cosmological signal. We also\nhighlight that the numerous low H I column density systems display lower\npeculiar acceleration. Finally, we propose a new 'Lya cell' technique that\napplies a small correction to the wavelength calibration to secure a relative\nmeasurement of the cosmic drift between two unrelated cosmological sources at\ndifferent redshifts. For suitable combinations of absorption lines, the\ncosmological signal can be more than doubled, while the affect of the observer\npeculiar acceleration is mitigated. Using current data of four suitable Lya\ncells, we infer a limit on the cosmological redshift drift to be dv/dt_obs < 65\nm/s/year (2 sigma).\n"}
{"title": "Resilience of Dynamic Routing in the Face of Recurrent and Random\n  Sensing Faults", "trgt": "  Feedback dynamic routing is a commonly used control strategy in\ntransportation systems. This class of control strategies relies on real-time\ninformation about the traffic state in each link. However, such information may\nnot always be observable due to temporary sensing faults. In this article, we\nconsider dynamic routing over two parallel routes, where the sensing on each\nlink is subject to recurrent and random faults. The faults occur and clear\naccording to a finite-state Markov chain. When the sensing is faulty on a link,\nthe traffic state on that link appears to be zero to the controller. Building\non the theories of Markov processes and monotone dynamical systems, we derive\nlower and upper bounds for the resilience score, i.e. the guaranteed throughput\nof the network, in the face of sensing faults by establishing stability\nconditions for the network. We use these results to study how a variety of key\nparameters affect the resilience score of the network. The main conclusions\nare: (i) Sensing faults can reduce throughput and destabilize a nominally\nstable network; (ii) A higher failure rate does not necessarily reduce\nthroughput, and there may exist a worst rate that minimizes throughput; (iii)\nHigher correlation between the failure probabilities of two links leads to\ngreater throughput; (iv) A large difference in capacity between two links can\nresult in a drop in throughput.\n"}

The leading-twist\ntime-reversal even transverse momentum dependent parton distribution function\n(TMD) of the pion is then directly obtained from these LFWFs. A key\ncharacteristic of the LFWFs, which is driven by dynamical chiral symmetry\nbreaking, is that at typical hadronic scales they are broad functions in the\nlight-cone momentum fraction $x$. The LFWFs have a non-trivial $(x,k_T^2)$\ndependence and in general do not factorize into separate functions of each\nvariable. The $l_z=0$ LFWF is concave with a maximum at $x=1/2$, whereas\norbital angular momentum effects causes the $|l_z|=1$ LFWF to have a slight\n{\\it double-humped} structure for quark transverse momentum in the range $0.5\n\\lesssim k_T^2 \\lesssim 5\\,$GeV$^2$.

In this paper\nwe compare two indirect methods of updating namely, the Adaptive Metropolis\nHastings and a newly applied algorithm called Monte Carlo Dynamically Weighted\nImportance Sampling (MCDWIS). The approximation of a posterior predictive\ndistribution is based on Bayesian inference of continuous multivariate Gaussian\nprobability density functions, defining the variability of physical properties\naffected by forced vibration. The motivation behind applying MCDWIS is in the\ncomplexity of computing normalizing constants in higher dimensional or\nmultimodal systems. The MCDWIS accounts for this intractability by analytically\ncomputing importance sampling estimates at each time step of the algorithm.

{"title": "Measurement-based perturbation theory and differential equation\n  parameter estimation with applications to satellite gravimetry", "trgt": "  The numerical integration method has been routinely used to produce global\nstandard gravitational models from satellite tracking measurements of\nCHAMP/GRACE types. It is implemented by solving the differential equations of\nthe partial derivatives of a satellite orbit with respect to the unknown\nharmonic coefficients under the conditions of zero initial values. From the\nmathematical point of view, satellite gravimetry from satellite tracking is the\nproblem of estimating unknown parameters in the Newton's nonlinear differential\nequations from satellite tracking measurements. We prove that zero initial\nvalues for the partial derivatives are incorrect mathematically and not\npermitted physically. The numerical integration method, as currently\nimplemented and used in satellite gravimetry and statistics, is groundless. We\nuse three different methods to derive new local solutions to the Newton's\nnonlinear governing differential equations of motion with a nominal reference\norbit. Bearing in mind that satellite orbits can now be tracked almost\ncontinuously at unprecedented high accuracy, we propose the measurement-based\nperturbation theory and derive global uniformly convergent solutions to the\nNewton's nonlinear governing differential equations of motion. Since the\nsolutions are global uniformly convergent, they are able to extract smallest\npossible gravitational signals from modern and future satellite tracking\nmeasurements for global high-precision, high-resolution gravitational models.\nBy directly turning the nonlinear differential equations of satellite motion\ninto the nonlinear integral equations, we reformulate the links between\nsatellite tracking measurements and the global uniformly convergent solutions\nto the Newton's governing differential equations as a condition adjustment\nmodel with equality constraints.\n"}

Here we discuss the prospects of\ndetecting carbon dioxide at 15 um using a spectral filtering technique with the\nMedium Resolution Spectrograph (MRS) mode of the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI)\non the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). At superior conjunction, the planet\nis expected to show a contrast of up to 100 ppm with respect to the star. At a\nspectral resolving power of R=1790-2640, about 100 spectral CO2 features are\nvisible within the 13.2-15.8 um (3B) band, which can be combined to boost the\nplanet atmospheric signal by a factor 3-4, depending on the atmospheric\ntemperature structure and CO2 abundance. If atmospheric conditions are\nfavorable (assuming an Earth-like atmosphere), with this new application to the\ncross-correlation technique carbon dioxide can be detected within a few days of\nJWST observations. However, this can only be achieved if both the instrumental\nspectral response and the stellar spectrum can be determined to a relative\nprecision of <= 1e-4 between adjacent spectral channels.

In the upper part of the surface layer, the rate of turbulence\nproduction of TKE due to the shear is much smaller than that caused by the\nbuoyancy, which causes unusual strongly anisotropic buoyancy-driven turbulence.\nConsidering the applications of the obtained results to the atmospheric\nconvective and stably stratified boundary-layer turbulence, the theoretical\nrelationships potentially useful in modelling applications have been derived.\nIn particular, the developed unified theory for the surface layers in turbulent\nconvection and stably stratified turbulence allows us to determine the vertical\nprofiles for all turbulent characteristics, including TKE, the intensity of\nturbulent potential temperature fluctuations, the vertical turbulent fluxes of\nmomentum and buoyancy (proportional to potential temperature), the integral\nturbulence scale, the turbulent anisotropy, the turbulent Prandtl number and\nthe flux Richardson number.

Here by using data-science techniques, we clarified how\nthe microscopic parameters in the $ab$ $initio$ effective Hamiltonians\ncorrelate with the experimental $T_\\text{c}$s in iron-based superconductors. We\nshowed that a combination of microscopic parameters can characterize the\ncompound-dependence of $T_\\text{c}$ using the principal component analysis. We\nalso constructed a linear regression model that reproduces the experimental\n$T_\\text{c}$ from the microscopic parameters. Based on the regression model, we\nshowed a way for increasing $T_\\text{c}$ by changing the lattice parameters.\nThe developed methodology opens a new field of materials informatics for\nstrongly correlated electron systems.\n"}

This is\npartly due to the fact that most fairness metrics of interest depend on both\nthe sensitive attribute information and label information of the data points.\nIn many scenarios it is not possible to collect large datasets with such\ninformation. An alternate approach that is commonly used is to separately train\nan attribute classifier on data with sensitive attribute information, and then\nuse it later in the ML pipeline to evaluate the bias of a given classifier.\nWhile such decoupling helps alleviate the problem of demographic scarcity, it\nraises several natural questions such as: how should the attribute classifier\nbe trained?, and how should one use a given attribute classifier for accurate\nbias estimation? In this work we study this question from both theoretical and\nempirical perspectives.\n  We first experimentally demonstrate that the test accuracy of the attribute\nclassifier is not always correlated with its effectiveness in bias estimation\nfor a downstream model. In order to further investigate this phenomenon, we\nanalyze an idealized theoretical model and characterize the structure of the\noptimal classifier. Our analysis has surprising and counter-intuitive\nimplications where in certain regimes one might want to distribute the error of\nthe attribute classifier as unevenly as possible among the different subgroups.\nBased on our analysis we develop heuristics for both training and using\nattribute classifiers for bias estimation in the data scarce regime.

{"title": "Stable Reinforcement Learning with Unbounded State Space", "trgt": "  We consider the problem of reinforcement learning (RL) with unbounded state\nspace motivated by the classical problem of scheduling in a queueing network.\nTraditional policies as well as error metric that are designed for finite,\nbounded or compact state space, require infinite samples for providing any\nmeaningful performance guarantee (e.g. $\\ell_\\infty$ error) for unbounded state\nspace. That is, we need a new notion of performance metric. As the main\ncontribution of this work, inspired by the literature in queuing systems and\ncontrol theory, we propose stability as the notion of \"goodness\": the state\ndynamics under the policy should remain in a bounded region with high\nprobability. As a proof of concept, we propose an RL policy using\nSparse-Sampling-based Monte Carlo Oracle and argue that it satisfies the\nstability property as long as the system dynamics under the optimal policy\nrespects a Lyapunov function. The assumption of existence of a Lyapunov\nfunction is not restrictive as it is equivalent to the positive recurrence or\nstability property of any Markov chain, i.e., if there is any policy that can\nstabilize the system then it must possess a Lyapunov function. And, our policy\ndoes not utilize the knowledge of the specific Lyapunov function. To make our\nmethod sample efficient, we provide an improved, sample efficient\nSparse-Sampling-based Monte Carlo Oracle with Lipschitz value function that may\nbe of interest in its own right. Furthermore, we design an adaptive version of\nthe algorithm, based on carefully constructed statistical tests, which finds\nthe correct tuning parameter automatically.\n"}

The SFGs oscillate about the MS\nridge on timescales $\\sim0.4~t_{\\mathrm{Hubble}}$ ($\\sim1$ Gyr at $z\\sim3$).\nThe propagation upwards is due to gas compaction, triggered, e.g., by mergers,\ncounter-rotating streams, and/or violent disc instabilities.

We first show that the parameter space of\nHTM0, usually delimited by combined constraints originating from unitarity and\nBFB as well as experimental limits from LEP and LHC, is severely reduced when\nthe modified Veltman conditions at one loop are also imposed. Then, we perform\nan rigorous analysis of Higgs decays either when $h^0$ is the SM-like or when\nthe heaviest neutral Higgs $H^0$ is identified to the observed $125$ GeV Higgs\nboson at LHC. In these scenarios, we perform an extensive parameter scan, in\nthe lower part of the scalar mass spectrum, with a particular focus on the\nHiggs to Higgs decay modes $H^0 \\to h^0h^0, H^\\pm\\,H^\\mp$ leading predominantly\nto invisible Higgs decays. Finally, we also study the scenario where $h^0, H^0$\nare mass degenerate.

The brightest (K=18.8)\nobject has a standard type II AGN spectrum, and is the most likely location of\nthe AGN, which implies a one-sided jet radio morphology. Deep 113 GHz\nobservations with the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer reveal CO J=4-3\nemission, which peaks at the position of the AGN. The CO line is offset by 500\nkm/s from the systemic redshift of the AGN, but corresponds very closely to the\nvelocity shift of an associated HI absorber seen in Lya. This strongly suggests\nthat both originate from the same gas reservoir surrounding the AGN host\ngalaxy. Simultaneous 230 GHz interferometer observations find a ~3x lower\nintegrated flux density when compared to single dish 250 GHz observations with\nMAMBO at the IRAM 30m telescope.

Or, we may have available models for\nlabeling whole passages (say, with sentiments), which we would like to exploit\ntoward better position-specific label inference (say, target-dependent\nsentiment annotation). A key characteristic shared across such tasks is that\ndifferent positions in a primary instance can benefit from different `experts'\ntrained from auxiliary data, but labeled primary instances are scarce, and\nlabeling the best expert for each position entails unacceptable cognitive\nburden.

A primary instance is also submitted to each auxiliary\nRNN, but their state sequences are gated and merged into a novel composite\nstate sequence tailored to the primary inference task. Our approach is in sharp\ncontrast to recent multi-task networks like the cross-stitch and sluice\nnetwork, which do not control state transfer at such fine granularity. We\ndemonstrate the superiority of GIRNet using three applications: sentiment\nclassification of code-switched passages, part-of-speech tagging of\ncode-switched text, and target position-sensitive annotation of sentiment in\nmonolingual passages.

{"title": "Radiation induced warping of protostellar accretion disks", "trgt": "  We examine the consequences of radiatively driven warping of accretion disks\nsurrounding pre-main-sequence stars. These disks are stable against warping if\nthe luminosity arises from a steady accretion flow, but are unstable at late\ntimes when the intrinsic luminosity of the star overwhelms that provided by the\ndisk. Warps can be excited for stars with luminosities of around 10 solar\nluminosities or greater, with larger and more severe warps in the more luminous\nsystems. A twisted inner disk may lead to high extinction towards stars often\nviewed through their disks. After the disk at all radii becomes optically thin,\nthe warp decays gradually on the local viscous timescale, which is likely to be\nlong. We suggest that radiation induced warping may account for the origin of\nthe warped dust disk seen in Beta Pictoris, if the star is only around 10-20\nMyr old, and could lead to non-coplanar planetary systems around higher mass\nstars.\n"}

This shift is largely due to\nthe signal from the newly-sampled regions of space, rather than the refinements\nin the treatment of observational selection. This analysis therefore implies a\ndensity significantly below the standard $\\Omega_{M} =0.3$: in combination with\nCMB data from WMAP, we infer $\\Omega_{M} =0.231\\pm 0.021$. (Abridged.)\n"}
{"title": "Toplayer-Dependent Crystallographic Orientation Imaging in the Bilayer\n  Two-Dimensional Materials with Transverse Shear Microscopy", "trgt": "  Nanocontact properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials are closely\ndependent on their unique nanomechanical systems, such as the number of atomic\nlayers and the supporting substrate. Here, we report a direct observation of\ntoplayer-dependent crystallographic orientation imaging of 2D materials with\nthe transverse shear microscopy (TSM). Three typical nanomechanical systems,\nMoS2 on the amorphous SiO2/Si, graphene on the amorphous SiO2/Si, and MoS2 on\nthe crystallized Al2O3, have been investigated in detail. This experimental\nobservation reveals that puckering behaviour mainly occurs on the top layer of\n2D materials, which is attributed to its direct contact adhesion with the AFM\ntip. Furthermore, the result of crystallographic orientation imaging of\nMoS2/SiO2/Si and MoS2/Al2O3 indicated that the underlying crystalline\nsubstrates almost do not contribute to the puckering effect of 2D materials.\nOur work directly revealed the top layer dependent puckering properties of 2D\nmaterial, and demonstrate the general applications of TSM in the bilayer 2D\nsystems.\n"}

This\nis the first study to analyze hierarchical structure over five scales in the\nsame cloud complex. We compare the number of fragments with the number of Jeans\nmasses in each scale to calculate the Jeans efficiency, or the ratio of\nobserved to expected number of fragments. The velocity dispersion is assumed to\narise either from purely thermal motions, or from combined thermal and\nnon-thermal motions inferred from observed spectral line widths.

The Hubble sequence also follows\na banana-shaped correlation between 24 and 70 micron luminosities, both\nnormalized with the K-band luminosity. We show that this correlation is\nsignificantly tightened if galaxies with central AGN emission are removed, but\nthe cosmic scatter of elliptical galaxies in both 24 and 70 micron luminosities\nremains significant along the correlation. We find that the 24 micron variation\namong ellipticals correlates with stellar metallicity, reflecting emission from\nhot dust in winds from asymptotic giant branch stars of varying metallicity.\nInfrared surface brightness variations in elliptical galaxies indicate that the\nK - 24 color profile is U-shaped for reasons that are unclear. In some\nelliptical galaxies cold interstellar dust emitting at 70 and 160 microns may\narise from recent gas-rich mergers. However, we argue that most of the large\nrange of 70 micron luminosity in elliptical galaxies is due to dust transported\nfrom galactic cores by feedback events in (currently IR-quiet) active galactic\nnuclei. Cooler dusty gas naturally accumulates in the cores of elliptical\ngalaxies due to dust-cooled local stellar mass loss and may accrete onto the\ncentral black hole, releasing energy. AGN-heated gas can transport dust in\ncores 5-10 kpc out into the hot gas atmospheres where it radiates extended 70\nmicron emission but is eventually destroyed by sputtering. This, and some\nmodest star formation, defines a cycle of dust creation and destruction.\nElliptical galaxies evidently undergo large transient excursions in the banana\nplot in times comparable to the sputtering time or AGN duty cycle, 10 Myrs.\nNormally regarded as passive, elliptical galaxies are the most active galaxies\nin the IR color-color correlation.\n"}

However, many\ntraits of interest appear to be subject to multifactorial control by groups of\ngenetic loci instead. Accurate detection of such multivariate associations is\nnontrivial and often hindered by limited power. At the same time, confounding\ninfluences such as population structure cause spurious association signals that\nresult in false positive findings if they are not accounted for in the model.\nHere, we propose LMM-Lasso, a mixed model that allows for both, multi-locus\nmapping and correction for confounding effects.

{"title": "Sweepouts of closed Riemannian manifolds", "trgt": "  We show that for every closed Riemannian manifold there exists a continuous\nfamily of $1$-cycles (defined as finite collections of disjoint closed curves)\nparametrized by a sphere and sweeping out the whole manifold so that the\nlengths of all connected closed curves are bounded in terms of the volume (or\nthe diameter) and the dimension $n$ of the manifold, when $n \\geq 3$. An\nalternative form of this result involves a modification of Gromov's definition\nof waist of sweepouts, where the space of parameters can be any finite\npolyhedron (and not necessarily a pseudomanifold). We demonstrate that the\nso-defined polyhedral $1$-dimensional waist of a closed Riemannian manifold is\nequal to its filling radius up to at most a constant factor. We also establish\nupper bounds for the polyhedral $1$-waist of some homology classes in terms of\nthe volume or the diameter of the ambient manifold. In addition, we provide\ngeneralizations of these results for sweepouts by polyhedra of higher dimension\nusing the homological filling functions. Finally, we demonstrate that the\nfilling radius and the hypersphericity of a closed Riemannian manifold can be\narbitrarily far apart.\n"}

This unusual afterglow is clearly inconsistent with\nthe standard afterglow shock model. Here we propose a non-standard model for\nthe unusual R-band afterglow of GRB 000301c. In this model, an\nultra-relativistic shock in a dense medium (\"dirty environment\")rapidly evolved\nto the non-relativistic phase in initial 1 day. During such a phase, the shock\nhappened to be caught up with by two energetic shells ejected from the central\nengine at two different times, and the shock was refreshed, leading to two\nflattenings of the light curve. After each interaction between the shock and\nshell, the afterglow decayed as $\\propto t^{-3.0}$ if the electron distribution\nindex of the shocked medium, $p\\approx 3.4$, derived from the optical spectrum.\nTherefore, this model can provide an excellent explanation for the flattening\nand steepening features of the GRB 000301c optical afterglow light curve.

In\nthis paper, we investigate multiple ways to improve the performance of FaSNet.\nFrom the problem formulation perspective, we change the explicit time-domain\nfilter-and-sum operation which involves all the microphones into an implicit\nfilter-and-sum operation in the latent space of only the reference microphone.\nThe filter-and-sum operation is applied on a context around the frame to be\nseparated.

{"title": "Enhanced energy harvesting from shadow-effect: mechanism and a new\n  device geometry", "trgt": "  Energy harvesting from shadow-effect is the generation of electrical power\nfrom a Schottky junction when a part of it is kept in shadow and the remaining\nunder illumination. It has been recently invented in Au/n-Si junctions, where\nmodulation of work function of the Au top electrode under contrasting\nillumination has been invoked to explain the effect. In this paper, a different\nphysical mechanism for energy harvesting from shadow-effect in a Schottky\njunction is proposed that does not assume change in work function of the top\nelectrode under illumination. The device, termed shadow-effect energy generator\n(SEG), is modelled as two parallel Schottky junction solar cells, one at the\nshadowed and the other at the illuminated part, connected with each other in a\nclosed loop circuit through the Si substrate and the top electrode. To test the\nproposed mechanism, ITO/n-Si junction based SEGs have been fabricated. The\nvalues of open circuit voltage in the SEGs have been found to be matching with\nthe difference of photovoltages of the two cells corrected for the potential\ndrop across the Si substrate, that validates the proposed mechanism. To further\ncorroborate the mechanism, the conventional SEG geometry has been modified by\napplying a continuous ohmic coating at the back of the Si substrates that\nbypasses the resistance of the Si substrate for current flow and results in\nhigher open circuit voltage and short circuit current. Moreover, ITO/n-Si based\nSEGs have been found to produce higher output power density compared to that\nreported in Au/n-Si devices in both the conventional and the new geometry.\nAlthough the closed loop present in the equivalent circuit of the SEG devices\nlead to wastage of harvested energy, the ITO/n-Si SEG devices can nevertheless\nbe used as self-powered sensor for light, object and movement detection as well\nas for producing electricity from contrasting illumination.\n"}

By turning the\nself-gravity of the gas in the simulations on or off, we demonstrate that\nself-gravity is the dominant physical effect setting the mass accretion rate at\nearly times before feedback effects take over, contrary to theories of\nturbulence-regulated star formation. We find that gravitational collapse\nsteepens the density profile around stars, generating the power-law tail on\nwhat is otherwise a lognormal density probability distribution function.\nFurthermore, we find turbulent velocity profiles to flatten inside collapsing\nregions, altering the size-linewidth relation. This local flattening reflects\nenhancements of turbulent velocity on small scales, as verified by changes to\nthe velocity power spectra. Our results indicate that gas self-gravity\ndynamically alters both density and velocity structures in clouds, giving rise\nto a time-varying star formation rate.

To address this issue, policy makers and other stakeholders, such\nas the European Commission or NIST, have proposed high-level guidelines aiming\nto promote trustworthy ML (i.e., lawful, ethical and robust). However, these\nguidelines do not specify actions to be taken by those involved in building ML\nsystems. In this paper, we argue that guidelines related to the development of\ntrustworthy ML can be translated to operational practices, and should become\npart of the ML development life cycle. Towards this goal, we ran a multi-vocal\nliterature review, and mined operational practices from white and grey\nliterature. Moreover, we launched a global survey to measure practice adoption\nand the effects of these practices. In total, we identified 14 new practices,\nand used them to complement an existing catalogue of ML engineering practices.\nInitial analysis of the survey results reveals that so far, practice adoption\nfor trustworthy ML is relatively low. In particular, practices related to\nassuring security of ML components have very low adoption. Other practices\nenjoy slightly larger adoption, such as providing explanations to users. Our\nextended practice catalogue can be used by ML development teams to bridge the\ngap between high-level guidelines and actual development of trustworthy ML\nsystems; it is open for review and contribution\n"}

{"title": "Path Integral Molecular Dynamics for Fermions: Alleviating the Sign\n  Problem with the Bogoliubov Inequality", "trgt": "  We present a method for performing path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD)\nsimulations for fermions and address its sign problem. PIMD simulations are\nwidely used for studying many-body quantum systems at thermal equilibrium.\nHowever, they assume that the particles are distinguishable and neglect bosonic\nand fermionic exchange effects. Interacting fermions play a key role in many\nchemical and physical systems, such as electrons in quantum dots and ultracold\ntrapped atoms. A direct sampling of the fermionic partition function is\nimpossible using PIMD since its integrand is not positive definite. We show\nthat PIMD simulations for fermions are feasible by employing our recently\ndeveloped method for bosonic PIMD and reweighting the results to obtain\nfermionic expectation values. The approach is tested against path integral\nMonte Carlo (PIMC) simulations for up to 7 electrons in a two-dimensional\nquantum dot for a range of interaction strengths. However, like PIMC, the\nmethod suffers from the sign problem at low temperatures. We propose a simple\napproach for alleviating it by simulating an auxiliary system with a larger\naverage sign and obtaining an upper bound to the energy of the original system\nusing the Bogoliubov inequality. This allows fermions to be studied at\ntemperatures lower than would otherwise have been feasible using PIMD, as\ndemonstrated in the case of a three-electron quantum dot. Our results extend\nthe boundaries of PIMD simulations of fermions and will hopefully stimulate the\ndevelopment of new approaches for tackling the sign problem.\n"}

On specific learning tasks, we find that likelihood\nmaximisation is achieved by models with maximal relevance. Training of\nRestricted Boltzmann Machines on the MNIST benchmark shows that learning is\nassociated with a broadening of the spectrum of energy levels and that the\ninternal representation of the hidden layer approaches the maximal relevance\nthat can be achieved in a finite dataset. Finally, we discuss a Gaussian\nlearning machine that clarifies that learning hidden features is conceptually\ndifferent from parameter estimation.\n"}

Additionally, the\nrelevance of considering the dissipation rates as complex quantities is\ndiscussed in both cases. More particularly, we find that the imaginary part of\nthe rates can not be neglected with the usual argument that it simply amounts\nto an energy shift, and in fact influences crucially the system dynamics.\n"}
{"title": "Combinatorics of free vertex algebras", "trgt": "  This paper illustrates the combinatorial approach to vertex algebra - study\nof vertex algebras presented by generators and relations. A necessary\ningredient of this method is the notion of free vertex algebra. Borcherds\n\\cite{bor} was the first to note that free vertex algebras do not exist in\ngeneral. The reason for this is that vertex algebras do not form a variety of\nalgebras, because the locality axiom (see sec 2 below) is not an identity.\nHowever, a certain subcategory of vertex algebras, obtained by restricting the\norder of locality of generators, has a universal object, which we call the free\nvertex algebra corresponding to the given locality bound. In [J. of Algebra,\n217(2):496-527] some free vertex algebras were constructed and in certain\nspecial cases their linear bases were found. In this paper we generalize this\nconstruction and find linear bases of an arbitrary free vertex algebra.\n  It turns out that free vertex algebras are closely related to the vertex\nalgebras corresponding to integer lattices. The latter algebras play a very\nimportant role in different areas of mathematics and physics. Here we explore\nthe relation between free vertex algebras and lattice vertex algebras in much\ndetail. These results comply with the use of the word \"free\" in physical\nliterature refering to some elements of lattice vertex algebras, like in \"free\nfield\", \"free bozon\" or \"free fermion\".\n  Among other things, we find a nice presentation of lattice vertex algebras in\nterms of generators and relations, thus giving an alternative construction of\nthese algebras without using vertex operators. We remark that our construction\nworks in a very general setting; we do not assume the lattice to be positive\ndefinite, neither non-degenerate, nor of a finite rank.\n"}

{"title": "The Ultraviolet Structure of Half-Maximal Supergravity with Matter\n  Multiplets at Two and Three Loops", "trgt": "  Using the duality between color and kinematics, we construct the two- and\nthree-loop amplitudes of half-maximal supergravity with matter multiplets and\nshow that new divergences occur in D=4 and D=5. Bossard, Howe and Stelle have\nrecently conjectured the existence of 16-supercharge off-shell harmonic\nsuperspaces in order to explain the ultraviolet finiteness of pure half-maximal\nsupergravity with no matter multiplets in D=4 at three loops and in D=5 at two\nloops. By assuming the required superspace exists in D=5, they argued that no\nnew divergences should occur at two loops even with the addition of\nabelian-vector matter multiplets. Up to possible issues with the SL(2,R) global\nanomaly of the theory, they reached a similar conclusion in D=4 for two and\nthree loops. The divergences we find contradict these predictions based on the\nexistence of the desired off-shell superspaces. Furthermore, our D=4 results\nare incompatible with the new divergences being due to the anomaly. We find\nthat the two-loop divergences of half-maximal supergravity are directly\ncontrolled by the divergences appearing in ordinary nonsupersymmetric\nYang-Mills theory coupled to scalars, explaining why half-maximal supergravity\ndevelops new divergences when matter multiplets are added. We also provide a\nlist of one- and two-loop counterterms that should be helpful for constraining\nany future potential explanations of the observed vanishings of divergences in\npure half-maximal supergravity.\n"}
{"title": "Open-world Learning and Application to Product Classification", "trgt": "  Classic supervised learning makes the closed-world assumption, meaning that\nclasses seen in testing must have been seen in training. However, in the\ndynamic world, new or unseen class examples may appear constantly. A model\nworking in such an environment must be able to reject unseen classes (not seen\nor used in training). If enough data is collected for the unseen classes, the\nsystem should incrementally learn to accept/classify them. This learning\nparadigm is called open-world learning (OWL). Existing OWL methods all need\nsome form of re-training to accept or include the new classes in the overall\nmodel. In this paper, we propose a meta-learning approach to the problem. Its\nkey novelty is that it only needs to train a meta-classifier, which can then\ncontinually accept new classes when they have enough labeled data for the\nmeta-classifier to use, and also detect/reject future unseen classes. No\nre-training of the meta-classifier or a new overall classifier covering all old\nand new classes is needed. In testing, the method only uses the examples of the\nseen classes (including the newly added classes) on-the-fly for classification\nand rejection.

Despite its vital\nimportance the microscopic behavior of a system is usually not formulated in\nterms of dissipation because the latter is not a readily measureable quantity\non the microscale.

In this work, we analytically study the viscous flow and elastic\ndeformation created due to inflation of such spherical chambers from one or two\ninlets. Our investigation considers the shell's constitutive hyperelastic law\ncoupled with the flow dynamics inside the chamber. For the case of a narrow\ntube filling a larger chamber, the pressure within the chamber involves a large\nspatially uniform part, and a small order correction. We derive a closed-form\nexpression for the inflation dynamics, accounting for the effect of elastic\nbi-stability. Interestingly, the obtained pressure distribution shows that the\nmaximal pressure on the chamber's surface is greater than the pressure at the\nentrance to the chamber. The calculated series solution of the velocity and\npressure fields during inflation is verified by using a fully coupled finite\nelement scheme, resulting in excellent agreement. Our results allow estimating\nthe chamber's viscous resistance at different pressures, thus enabling us to\nmodel the process of inflation and deflation.\n"}

Considering that magnetic-gradients\nare ubiquitous in solar plasma loops, this work applies the magnetic-gradient\npumping (MGP) mechanism to study the early evolution of flaring plasma loops.\nThe results indicate that the early evolution depend on the magnetic field\ndistribution and the geometry of the plasma loops which dominates the balance\nbetween the accumulation and dissipation of energy around loop-tops. Driven by\nMGP process, both of the density and temperature as well as the plasma beta\nvalue around the looptop will increase in the early phase of the plasma loops\nevolution. In fact, the solar plasma loops will have two distinct evolutionary\nresults: the low, initial dense plasma loops with relatively strong magnetic\nfields tend to be stable for their maximum beta value always smaller than the\ncritical value, while the higher, initial dilute solar plasma loops with\nrelatively weak magnetic fields tend to be unstable for their beta values\nexceeding the critical value at a time of about one hour after the formation of\nthe solar magnetized plasma loop.

Its\napplication is vast, e.g. in neural network, compressed sensing, clustering,\netc. to name just a few. In this paper, the independence constraint in VB will\nbe relaxed to a conditional constraint class, called copula in statistics.\nSince a joint probability distribution always belongs to a copula class, the\nnovel copula VB (CVB) approximation is a generalized form of VB. Via\ninformation geometry, we will see that CVB algorithm iteratively projects the\noriginal joint distribution to a copula constraint space until it reaches a\nlocal minimum Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. By this way, all mean-field\napproximations, e.g. iterative VB, Expectation-Maximization (EM), Iterated\nConditional Mode (ICM) and k-means algorithms, are special cases of CVB\napproximation.\n  For a generic Bayesian network, an augmented hierarchy form of CVB will also\nbe designed. While mean-field algorithms can only return a locally optimal\napproximation for a correlated network, the augmented CVB network, which is an\noptimally weighted average of a mixture of simpler network structures, can\npotentially achieve the globally optimal approximation for the first time.

(3) demonstration of\nstate of the art results, in two challenging datasets, H3D and MPII (where\nfigure-ground segmentation annotations have been added by us), where we\nsubstantially improve on the first ranked hypothesis estimates of mid-level\nsegmentation methods, by 20%, with hypothesis set sizes that are up to one\norder of magnitude smaller.\n"}

{"title": "Multiple Spawning with Optimal Basis Set Expansion", "trgt": "  The Full Multiple Spawning (FMS) method is designed to simulate quantum\ndynamics in the multi-state electronic problem. The FMS nuclear wavefunction is\nrepresented in a basis of coupled, frozen Gaussians, and the spawning procedure\nprescribes a means of adaptively increasing the size of the basis in order to\ncapture population transfer between electronic states. Parent trajectories\ncreate children when passing through regions of significant nonadiabatic\ncoupling. In order to converge branching ratios without allowing the basis to\nreach an impractical size, population transfer at individual spawning events\nshould be made as effective as possible. Herein we detail a new algorithm for\nspecifying the initial conditions of freshly spawned basis functions, one that\nminimizes the number of spawns needed for convergence by maximizing the\nefficiency of individual spawning events. Optimization is achieved by\nmaximizing the coupling between parent and child trajectories, as a function of\nchild position and momentum, at the point of spawning. The method is tested\nwith a two-state, one-mode avoided crossing model and a two-state, two-mode\nconical intersection model.\n"}

{"title": "Anti-plane Shear Waves in Layered Composites: Band Structure and\n  Anomalous Wave-refraction", "trgt": "  For oblique anti-plane shear waves in periodic layered elastic composites, it\nis shown that negative energy refraction is accompanied by positive\nphase-velocity refraction and positive energy refraction is accompanied by\nnegative phase-velocity refraction, and that, this happens over a broad range\nof frequencies. The composite's unit cell may consist of any number of layers\nof any variable mass-density and elastic shear modulus (with large\ndiscontinuities).\n  Explicit series expressions for displacement, velocity, strain and stress\ncomponents, and energy-flux fields are given, and group-velocity vector is\ncalculated. The approach is based on a mixed variational principle where the\ndisplacement and stress components are viewed as independent fields subject to\narbitrary variation. These fields are hence approximated independently, thereby\nensuring the necessary continuity conditions. The resulting computational\nmethod yields the composite's frequency band structure and the associated mode\nshapes, in terms of the wave-vector components for any desired number of\nfrequency bands.\n  The general results are illustrated using a two-phase and a three-phase unit\ncell with piecewise constant properties. It is shown that on their second\nfrequency pass-bands, only the components of the phase and group velocities\nnormal to the layers are antiparallel, while the components along the layers\nare parallel. Therefore, both the two-phase and the three-phase composites\ndisplay negative energy refraction with positive phase-velocity refraction and\npositive phase-velocity refraction with negative energy refraction, depending\non how the composite is interfaced with a homogeneous solid.\n  The presented method is applicable and effective also when some or all of the\nlayers in a unit cell have spatially varying properties.\n"}

The analysis of the data gathered from the devices\ninstalled on the heating bodies, together with the measurements of the overall\nbuilding heat consumption provided by direct heat metering, allows the\nevaluation of the characteristic thermal model parameters of heating bodies at\nactual installation and working conditions. Thus overcoming the negative impact\non accuracy of conventional indirect heat accounting due to off-design\noperation, in which these measurement systems normally operate.

[Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 010501 (2008)]\nwhere the braiding operation is shown to be equivalent to a series of\ntopological charge \"forced measurements\" of anyons. In a forced measurement,\nthe charge measurement is forced to yield the desired outcome (e.g. charge 0)\nvia repeatedly measuring charges in different bases. This is a probabilistical\nprocess with a certain success probability for each trial. In practice, the\nnumber of measurements needed will vary from run to run. We show that such an\nuncertainty associated with forced measurements can be removed by simulating\nthe braiding operation using a fixed number of three measurements supplemented\nby a correction operator. Furthermore, we demonstrate that in practice we can\navoid applying the correction operator in hardware by implementing it in\nsoftware. Our findings greatly simplify the MOTQC proposal and only require the\ncapability of performing charge measurements to implement topologically\nprotected transformations generated by braiding exchanges without physically\nmoving anyons.\n"}

{"title": "Inferring Objectives in Continuous Dynamic Games from Noise-Corrupted\n  Partial State Observations", "trgt": "  Robots and autonomous systems must interact with one another and their\nenvironment to provide high-quality services to their users. Dynamic game\ntheory provides an expressive theoretical framework for modeling scenarios\ninvolving multiple agents with differing objectives interacting over time. A\ncore challenge when formulating a dynamic game is designing objectives for each\nagent that capture desired behavior. In this paper, we propose a method for\ninferring parametric objective models of multiple agents based on observed\ninteractions. Our inverse game solver jointly optimizes player objectives and\ncontinuous-state estimates by coupling them through Nash equilibrium\nconstraints. Hence, our method is able to directly maximize the observation\nlikelihood rather than other non-probabilistic surrogate criteria. Our method\ndoes not require full observations of game states or player strategies to\nidentify player objectives. Instead, it robustly recovers this information from\nnoisy, partial state observations. As a byproduct of estimating player\nobjectives, our method computes a Nash equilibrium trajectory corresponding to\nthose objectives. Thus, it is suitable for downstream trajectory forecasting\ntasks. We demonstrate our method in several simulated traffic scenarios.\nResults show that it reliably estimates player objectives from a short sequence\nof noise-corrupted partial state observations. Furthermore, using the estimated\nobjectives, our method makes accurate predictions of each player's trajectory.\n"}

The preceding data demonstrated that Ti particles of\n~1-12 micron size, electrosterically modified by the PDADMAC charging agent,\nacted effectively as colloidal particles during EPD. Owing to the non-colloidal\nnature of the particles and the stabilization of the Ti particles by\nelectrosteric forces, the relevance of the zeta potential is questionable, so\nthe more fundamental parameter of electrophoretic mobility was used. A key\nfinding from the present work is the importance of assessing the\nelectrophoretic mobilities of both the suspensions and solutions since the\nlatter, which normally is overlooked, plays a critical role in the ability to\ninterpret the results meaningfully. Further, algebraic uncoupling of these data\nplus determination of the deposit yield as a function of charging agent\naddition allow discrimination between the three main mechanistic stages of the\nelectrokinetics of the process, which are: (1) surface saturation; (2)\ncompression of the diffuse layer, growth of polymer-rich layer, and/or\ncompetition between the mobility of Ti and PDADMAC; and (3) little or no\ndecrease in electrophoretic mobility of Ti, establishment of polymer-rich\nlayer, and/or dominance of the mobility of the PDADMAC over that of Ti.\n"}

In regular lattices the diffusion of\nthe two species is normal but the $B$ particles are significantly slower, due\nto the presence of the $A$ particles. From the fraction of sites where the $B$\nparticles can move freely, which we compute analytically, we derive the\ndiffusion coefficients of the two species. In heterogeneous networks the\nfraction of sites where $B$ is free decreases exponentially with the degree of\nthe sites. This, coupled with accumulation of particles in high-degree nodes\nleads to trapping of the low priority particles in scale-free networks.\n"}

{"title": "The Equation of State of the Intergalactic Medium After Hydrogen\n  Reionization", "trgt": "  We use an analytic model to study how inhomogeneous hydrogen reionization\naffects the temperature distribution of the intergalactic medium (IGM). During\nthis process, the residual energy of each ionizing photon is deposited in the\nIGM as heat, increasing its temperature to 20,000-30,000 K; subsequent\nexpansion of the Universe then cools the gas. Because reionization most likely\nproceeds from high to low densities, underdense voids are ionized last, have\nless time to cool, and are (on average) warmer than mean-density gas\nimmediately after reionization is complete (an \"inverted\" equation of state).\n  From this initial configuration, the low-density gas cools quickly and\neventually returns to a more normal equation of state. The rapidly evolving\ntemperature introduces systematic uncertainties in measurements of the ionizing\nbackground at z~6. For example, late reionization implies rapid cooling, so\nthat the ionizing background would have to evolve even more rapidly at z ~5-6\nthan typically claimed. This degeneracy is difficult to disentangle, because\nthe Lyman-alpha forest probes only a narrow range in densities (over which the\ngas is nearly isothermal). However, higher Lyman-series transitions probe wider\ndensity ranges, sampling different effective temperatures, and offer a new way\nto measure the IGM equation of state that should work where nearly saturated\nabsorption precludes other methods. This will help to separate evolution in\ntemperature from that in the ionizing background. While more detailed study\nwith hydrodynamic simulations is needed, we show that such measurements could\npotentially distinguish early and late reionization using only a handful of\nlines of sight.\n"}
{"title": "The in-medium few-body problem", "trgt": "  We are concerned with few-particle correlations in a fermionic system at\nfinite temperature and density. Within the many-body Green functions formalism\nthe description of correlations is provided by the Dyson equation approach that\nleads to effective few-body equations. They contain the dominant medium\neffects, which are self energy corrections and the Pauli blocking. Hence the\neffective two-body interactions between quasiparticles are\nmomentum/energy-dependent and therefore they can be usesed in the medium\nmodified, momentum space, integral AGS equations for three- and four-body\nsystems. To investigate correlations and clusters beyond four-body, we employ,\ninstead, the configuration space two-variable integro-differential equations\n(IDEA) for $A$-body bound systems which are based on Hyperspherical Harmonics\nand the Faddeev decomposition of the wave function in two-body amplitudes.

To achieve this we use inverse\nscattering techniques the resulting interactions being, on-- and (to all\npractical purposes) off--shell equivalent to the energy dependent potentials.\nIn this way we obtain binding energy results for the 2--, 3--, 4--, and\n16--particle in a medium at a finite temperature and various densities.

During the first part of the outburst (MJD\n58004-58012), the source shows an optical-NIR spectrum that is consistent with\nan optically thin synchrotron power-law from a jet. After MJD 58015, however,\nthe source faded considerably, the drop in flux being much more evident at\nlower frequencies. Before the fading, we measure a de-reddened flux density of\n$\\gtrsim$100 mJy in the mid-infrared, making MAXI J1535-571 one of the\nbrightest mid-infrared BHBs known so far. A significant softening of the X-ray\nspectrum is evident contemporaneous with the infrared fade. We interpret it as\ndue to the suppression of the jet emission, similar to the accretion-ejection\ncoupling seen in other BHBs. However, MAXI J1535-571 did not transition\nsmoothly to the soft state, instead showing X-ray hardness deviations,\nassociated with infrared flaring.

{"title": "Energetics of oxygen-octahedra rotations in perovskite oxides from first\n  principles", "trgt": "  We use first-principles methods to study oxygen-octahedra rotations in ABO3\nperovskite oxides. We focus on the short-period, perfectly antiphase or\nin-phase, tilt patterns that characterize most compounds and control their\nphysical (e.g., conductive, magnetic) properties. Based on an analytical form\nof the relevant potential energy surface, we discuss the conditions for the\nstability of polymorphs presenting different tilt patterns, and obtain\nnumerical results for a collection of thirty-five representative materials. Our\nresults reveal the mechanisms responsible for the frequent occurrence of a\nparticular structure that combines antiphase and in-phase rotations, i.e., the\northorhombic Pbnm phase displayed by about half of all perovskite oxides and by\nmany non-oxidic perovskites. The Pbnm phase benefits from the simultaneous\noccurrence of antiphase and in-phase tilt patterns that compete with each\nother, but not as strongly as to be mutually exclusive. We also find that\nsecondary antipolar modes, involving the A cations, contribute to weaken the\ncompetition between different tilts and play a key role in their coexistence.\nOur results thus confirm and better explain previous observations for\nparticular compounds. Interestingly, we also find that strain effects, which\nare known to be a major factor governing phase competition in related (e.g.,\nferroelectric) perovskite oxides, play no essential role as regards the\nrelative stability of different rotational polymorphs. Further, we discuss why\nthe Pbnm structure stops being the ground state in two opposite limits, for\nlarge and small A cations, showing that very different effects become relevant\nin each case. Our work thus provides a comprehensive discussion on these\nall-important and abundant materials, which will be useful to better understand\nexisting compounds as well as to identify new strategies for materials\nengineering.\n"}

Khuri's work is closely related to the\nisospectral compactness results of Osgood, Phillips, and Sarnak. Our main\ntheorem is an asymptotic formula for the determinant of the Laplacian on the\ndegenerating family of surfaces, up to terms which vanish in the singular\nlimit.

The correlations considered include the matter\ndensity-intrinsic ellipticity (mI), galaxy density-intrinsic ellipticity (dI),\ngravitational shear-intrinsic ellipticity (GI), and intrinsic\nellipticity-intrinsic ellipticity (II) correlations. We find stronger\ncorrelations for more massive and more luminous galaxies, as well as for\nearlier photometric types, in agreement with observations. Moreover, the\ncorrelations significantly depend on the choice of shape estimator, even if\ncalibrated to serve as unbiased shear estimators. In particular, shape\nestimators that down-weight the outer parts of galaxy images produce much\nweaker IA signals on intermediate and large scales than methods employing flat\nradial weights. The expected contribution of intrinsic alignments to the\nobserved ellipticity correlation in tomographic cosmic shear surveys may be\nbelow one percent or several percent of the full signal depending on the\ndetails of the shape measurement method.

Prior works on IRS have mostly assumed the availability of channel\nstate information (CSI) for designing its passive beamforming. However, the\nacquisition of CSI requires substantial training overhead that increases with\n$N$. In contrast, we propose in this letter a novel \\emph{random passive\nbeamforming} scheme, where the IRS performs independent random reflection for\n$Q\\geq 1$ times in each channel coherence interval without the need of CSI\nacquisition. For the proposed scheme, we first derive a closed-form\napproximation of the outage probability, based on which the optimal $Q$ with\nbest outage performance can be efficiently obtained.

Numerical results show that a small $Q$ is\npreferred in the high-outage regime (or with high rate target) and the optimal\n$Q$ becomes larger as the outage probability decreases (or as the rate target\ndecreases).

To accelerate\nthe convergence, some variance-reduced stochastic gradient algorithms, e.g.,\nproximal stochastic variance-reduced gradient (Prox-SVRG) algorithm, have\nrecently been proposed to solve strongly convex problems. Under the strongly\nconvex condition, these variance-reduced stochastic gradient algorithms achieve\na linear convergence rate. However, many machine learning problems are convex\nbut not strongly convex. In this paper, we introduce Prox-SVRG and its\nprojected variant called Variance-Reduced Projected Stochastic Gradient (VRPSG)\nto solve a class of non-strongly convex optimization problems widely used in\nmachine learning. As the main technical contribution of this paper, we show\nthat both VRPSG and Prox-SVRG achieve a linear convergence rate without strong\nconvexity.

However,\nthe lack and incompleteness of such information caused by intraoperative\nemergencies (such as bleeding) and risk control conditions have not been\nconsidered. In this paper, a novel hierarchical shape-perception network (HSPN)\nis proposed to reconstruct the 3D point clouds (PCs) of specific brains from\none single incomplete image with low latency. A branching predictor and several\nhierarchical attention pipelines are constructed to generate point clouds that\naccurately describe the incomplete images and then complete these point clouds\nwith high quality. Meanwhile, attention gate blocks (AGBs) are designed to\nefficiently aggregate geometric local features of incomplete PCs transmitted by\nhierarchical attention pipelines and internal features of reconstructing point\nclouds. With the proposed HSPN, 3D shape perception and completion can be\nachieved spontaneously.

{"title": "Performance comparison of dynamical decoupling sequences for a qubit in\n  a rapidly fluctuating spin-bath", "trgt": "  Avoiding the loss of coherence of quantum mechanical states is an important\nprerequisite for quantum information processing. Dynamical decoupling (DD) is\none of the most effective experimental methods for maintaining coherence,\nespecially when one can access only the qubit-system and not its environment\n(bath). It involves the application of pulses to the system whose net effect is\na reversal of the system-environment interaction. In any real system, however,\nthe environment is not static, and therefore the reversal of the\nsystem-environment interaction becomes imperfect if the spacing between\nrefocusing pulses becomes comparable to or longer than the correlation time of\nthe environment. The efficiency of the refocusing improves therefore if the\nspacing between the pulses is reduced. Here, we quantify the efficiency of\ndifferent DD sequences in preserving different quantum states. We use 13C\nnuclear spins as qubits and an environment of 1H nuclear spins as the\nenvironment, which couples to the qubit via magnetic dipole-dipole couplings.\nStrong dipole-dipole couplings between the proton spins result in a rapidly\nfluctuating environment with a correlation time of the order of 100 us. Our\nexperimental results show that short delays between the pulses yield better\nperformance if they are compared with the bath correlation time. However, as\nthe pulse spacing becomes shorter than the bath correlation time, an optimum is\nreached.

However, due to stringent\nrequirements of anti-commuting reflection symmetries in crystals, it has been\nchallenging to achieve higher-order quantized multipole moments, such as\noctupole moments, in a realistic three-dimensional (3D) structure. Here, we\novercome these challenges, and experimentally realize the acoustic analogue of\na quantized octupole topological insulator (QOTIs) using negatively coupled\nresonators. We confirm by first-principle studies that our design possesses a\nquantized octupole topological phase, and experimentally demonstrate\nspectroscopic evidence of a topological hierarchy of states in our\nmetamaterial, observing 3rd order corner states, 2nd order hinge states and 1st\norder surface states. Furthermore, we reveal topological phase transitions from\nhigher- to lower-order multipole moments in altered designs of acoustic TIs.\nOur work offers a new pathway to explore higher-order topological states\n(HOTSs) in 3D classical platforms.\n"}
{"title": "Exploring the Vulnerability of Deep Neural Networks: A Study of\n  Parameter Corruption", "trgt": "  We argue that the vulnerability of model parameters is of crucial value to\nthe study of model robustness and generalization but little research has been\ndevoted to understanding this matter. In this work, we propose an indicator to\nmeasure the robustness of neural network parameters by exploiting their\nvulnerability via parameter corruption. The proposed indicator describes the\nmaximum loss variation in the non-trivial worst-case scenario under parameter\ncorruption. For practical purposes, we give a gradient-based estimation, which\nis far more effective than random corruption trials that can hardly induce the\nworst accuracy degradation. Equipped with theoretical support and empirical\nvalidation, we are able to systematically investigate the robustness of\ndifferent model parameters and reveal vulnerability of deep neural networks\nthat has been rarely paid attention to before. Moreover, we can enhance the\nmodels accordingly with the proposed adversarial corruption-resistant training,\nwhich not only improves the parameter robustness but also translates into\naccuracy elevation.\n"}

{"title": "(Almost-)blind locking algorithm for high finesse suspended optical\n  cavities", "trgt": "  Suspended resonant optical cavities are basic building blocks for several\nexperimental devices. An important issue is the control strategy required to\nbring them in the resonant or slightly detuned configuration needed for their\noperation, the so-called \\textit{ locking} procedure. This can be obtained with\na feedback strategy, but the error signal needed is tipically available only\nwhen the cavity is near the resonance with a precision of the order $\\Delta\nL\\simeq\\lambda_{\\ell}{\\cal F}^{-1}$, where ${\\cal F}$ is the cavity finesse and\n$\\lambda_{\\ell}$ is the laser's wavelength. When the mirrors are freely\nswinging the locking can be attempted only in the short time windows when this\ncondition is verifyed. Tipically this means that the procedure must be repeated\nseveral times, and that large forces must be applied. In this paper we describe\na different strategy, which tries to take advantage by the fact that the\ndynamics of the mirrors is known at least in an approximate way. We argue that\nthe locking procedure considered can be more efficient compared with the naive\none, with a reduced needed maximal feedback. Finally we discuss possible\ngeneralizations and we point to future investigations.\n"}

Our\nanalysis decreases the upper limit for the H abundance to H < 6.0 (mass\nfraction < 7.1 x 10^-7). Our gravity corresponds to stellar mass M = 0.47 +/-\n0.03 M_sun.\n  We find that the effective log g varies through the pulsation cycle with an\namplitude of 0.28 dex.

Multilayer structures\ncomprising thin metal films with adjustable adhesion were fabricated. The\nCu/Ag/Ti/Si structures were grown on Si substrates and include thin Ti and Ag\nfilms and a thick Cu layer. The Ag and Ti films were deposited on the Si\nsubstrate under vacuum, and a thick Cu layer was subsequently electroplated\nonto the Ag surface. Later, the sandwich was separated and a vacuum nanogap was\nopened to produce two Ag/Cu and Ti/Si conformal electrodes. The adhesion\nstrength between the Ti and Ag films was precisely adjusted by exposing the\nstructures to dry O2 after Ti growth but before Ag growth. The resulting\nadhesion needed to be sufficiently high to allow electroplating of Cu and\nsufficiently low to allow subsequent separation. Either heating or cooling was\nused to separate the sandwiches. T he structures separated as a result of the\ndifferent thermal expansion parameters of the Si and Cu electrodes and the low\nadhesion between the Ti and Ag layers. After separation, the Ag and Ti surfaces\nwere analyzed optically using a Michelson interferometer. Adhesion regulation\nand optimization of the electroplating regime allowed fabrication of two\nconformal electrodes with a nanogap smaller than 5 nm and an area larger than 7\nmm2. Such electrodes can be used for efficient energy conversion and cooling in\nthe mixed thermionic and thermotunneling regime.\n"}

{"title": "Structural and optical properties of silicon nanocrystals embedded in\n  silicon carbide", "trgt": "  The outstanding demonstration of quantum confinement in Si nanocrystals (Si\nNC) in a SiC matrix requires the fabrication of Si NC with a narrow size\ndistribution. It is understood without controversy that this fabrication is a\ndifficult exercise and that a multilayer (ML) structure is suitable for such\nfabrication only in a narrow parameter range. This parameter range is sought by\nvarying both the stoichiometric SiC barrier thickness and the Si-rich SiC well\nthickness between 3 and 9 nm and comparing them to single layers (SL). The\nsamples processed for this investigation were deposited by plasma-enhanced\nchemical vapor deposition (PECVD) and subsequently subjected to thermal\nannealing at 1000-1100${\\deg}$C for crystal formation. Bulk information about\nthe entire sample area and depth were obtained by structural and optical\ncharacterization methods: information about the mean Si NC size was determined\nfrom grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) measurements.\nFourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was applied to gain insight into\nthe structure of the Si-C network, and spectrophotometry measurements were\nperformed to investigate the absorption coefficient and to estimate the bandgap\n$E_{04}$. All measurements showed that the influence of the ML structure on the\nSi NC size, on the Si-C network and on the absorption properties is subordinate\nto the influence of the overall Si content in the samples, which we identified\nas the key parameter for the structural and optical properties. We attribute\nthis behavior to interdiffusion of the barrier and well layers. Because the\nproduced Si NC are within the target size range of 2-4 nm for all layer\nthickness variations, we propose to use the Si content to adjust the Si NC size\nin future experiments.\n"}

{"title": "Evolutionary Design in Biological Quantum Computing", "trgt": "  The unique capability of quantum mechanics to evolve alternative\npossibilities in parallel is appealing and over the years a number of quantum\nalgorithms have been developed offering great computational benefits. Systems\ncoupled to the environment lose quantum coherence quickly and realization of\nschemes based on unitarity might be impossible. Recent discovery of room\ntemperature quantum coherence in light harvesting complexes opens up new\npossibilities to borrow concepts from biology to use quantum effects for\ncomputational purposes. While it has been conjectured that light harvesting\ncomplexes such as the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex in the green sulfur\nbacteria performs an efficient quantum search similar to the quantum Grover's\nalgorithm the analogy has yet to be established.\n  In this work we show that quantum dissipation plays an essential role in the\nquantum search performed in the FMO complex and it is fundamentally different\nfrom known algorithms. In the FMO complex not just the optimal level of phase\nbreaking is present to avoid both quantum localization and Zeno trapping but it\ncan harness quantum dissipation as well to speed the process even further up.\nWith detailed quantum calculations taking into account both phase breaking and\nquantum dissipation we show that the design of the FMO complex has been\nevolutionarily optimized and works faster than pure quantum or\nclassical-stochastic algorithms. Inspired by the findings we introduce a new\ncomputational concept based on decoherent quantum evolution. While it is\ninspired by light harvesting systems, the new computational devices can also be\nrealized on different material basis opening new magnitude scales for\nminiaturization and speed.\n"}

(b) how does\nthe rate of margin convergence depend on the tail of the loss function and the\nchoice of the step size? We show that for a large family of super-polynomial\ntailed losses, gradient descent iterates on linear networks of any depth\nconverge in the direction of $L_2$ maximum-margin solution, while this does not\nhold for losses with heavier tails. Within this family, for simple linear\nmodels we show that the optimal rates with fixed step size is indeed obtained\nfor the commonly used exponentially tailed losses such as logistic loss.\nHowever, with a fixed step size the optimal convergence rate is extremely slow\nas $1/\\log(t)$, as also proved in Soudry et al.

In the first task, I compare three popular\ngroups of lexicon generation methods: dictionary-, corpus-, and\nword-embedding-based ones, finding that dictionary-based systems generally\nyield better lexicons than the last two groups.

{"title": "A locality-based approach for coded computation", "trgt": "  Modern distributed computation infrastructures are often plagued by\nunavailabilities such as failing or slow servers.

A decoder can use the available function outputs to\ndecode the unavailable ones. Existing coded computation approaches are resource\nefficient only for simple variants of linear functions such as multilinear,\nwith even the class of low degree polynomials requiring the same multiplicative\noverhead as replication for practically relevant straggler tolerance.\n  In this paper, we present a new approach to model coded computation via the\nlens of locality of codes.

{"title": "Handgun detection using combined human pose and weapon appearance", "trgt": "  Closed-circuit television (CCTV) systems are essential nowadays to prevent\nsecurity threats or dangerous situations, in which early detection is crucial.\nNovel deep learning-based methods have allowed to develop automatic weapon\ndetectors with promising results. However, these approaches are mainly based on\nvisual weapon appearance only. For handguns, body pose may be a useful cue,\nespecially in cases where the gun is barely visible. In this work, a novel\nmethod is proposed to combine, in a single architecture, both weapon appearance\nand human pose information. First, pose keypoints are estimated to extract hand\nregions and generate binary pose images, which are the model inputs. Then, each\ninput is processed in different subnetworks and combined to produce the handgun\nbounding box. Results obtained show that the combined model improves the\nhandgun detection state of the art, achieving from 4.23 to 18.9 AP points more\nthan the best previous approach.\n"}

We explore the feasibility of\nsolving this problem by proposing a novel Quadratic Unconstrained Binary\nOptimization (QUBO) model. In recent years this QUBO formulation has gained\nincreasing attention since it represents the input for the specialized quantum\nannealer D-Wave machines.

A number of results demonstrate that this system operates with a\nprecision and efficiency near the limits imposed by physics, and more generally\nthese results point to the reliability and efficiency of the strategies that\nnature has selected for representing and processing visual signals. A recent\nseries of papers by Egelhaaf and coworkers, however, suggests that almost all\nthese conclusions are incorrect. In this contribution we place these\ncontroversies in a larger context, emphasizing that the arguments are not just\nabout flies, but rather about how we should quantify the neural response to\ncomplex, naturalistic inputs. As an example, Egelhaaf et al. (and many others)\ncompute certain correlation functions and use the apparent correlation times as\na measure of temporal precision in the neural response. This analysis neglects\nthe structure of the correlation function at short times, and we show how to\nanalyze this structure to reveal a temporal precision 30 times better than\nsuggested by the correlation time; this precision is confirmed by a much more\ndetailed information theoretic analysis. In reviewing other aspects of the\ncontroversy, we find that the analysis methods used by Egelhaaf et al. suffer\nfrom some mathematical inconsistencies, and that in some cases we are unable to\nreproduce their experimental results. Finally, we present results from new\nexperiments that probe the neural response to inputs that approach more closely\nthe natural context for freely flying flies.

The objective of\nthe entity is to maximize the number of components whose states are brought\nback to the fully repaired state within a given time. We prove that the general\nproblem is NP-hard, and therefore we characterize near-optimal control policies\nfor special instances of the problem. We show that when the deterioration rates\nare larger than or equal to the repair rates and the precedence constraints are\ngiven by a DAG, it is optimal to continue repairing a component until its state\nreaches the fully recovered state before switching to repair any other\ncomponent. Under the aforementioned assumptions and when the deterioration and\nthe repair rates are homogeneous across all the components, we prove that the\ncontrol policy that targets the healthiest component at each time-step while\nrespecting the precedence and time constraints fully repairs at least half the\nnumber of components that would be fully repaired by an optimal policy.\nFinally, we prove that when the repair rates are sufficiently larger than the\ndeterioration rates, the precedence constraints are given by a set of disjoint\ntrees that each contain at most k nodes, and there is no time constraint, the\npolicy that targets the component with the least value of health minus the\ndeterioration rate at each time-step while respecting the precedence\nconstraints fully repairs at least 1/k times the number of components that\nwould be fully repaired by an optimal policy.\n"}

{"title": "Performance of Refined Isogeometric Analysis in Solving Quadratic\n  Eigenvalue Problems", "trgt": "  Certain applications that analyze damping effects require the solution of\nquadratic eigenvalue problems (QEPs). We use refined isogeometric analysis\n(rIGA) to solve quadratic eigenproblems. rIGA discretization, while conserving\ndesirable properties of maximum-continuity isogeometric analysis (IGA), reduces\nthe interconnection between degrees of freedom by adding low-continuity basis\nfunctions. This connectivity reduction in rIGA's algebraic system results in\nfaster matrix LU factorizations when using multifrontal direct solvers. We\ncompare computational costs of rIGA versus those of IGA when employing Krylov\neigensolvers to solve quadratic eigenproblems arising in 2D vector-valued\nmultifield problems. For large problem sizes, the eigencomputation cost is\ngoverned by the cost of LU factorization, followed by costs of several\nmatrix-vector and vector-vector multiplications, which correspond to Krylov\nprojections. We minimize the computational cost by introducing C^0 and C^1\nseparators at specific element interfaces for our rIGA generalizations of the\ncurl-conforming Nedelec and divergence-conforming Raviart-Thomas finite\nelements. Let p be the polynomial degree of basis functions; the LU\nfactorization is up to O((p-1)^2) times faster when using rIGA compared to IGA\nin the asymptotic regime. Thus, rIGA theoretically improves the total\neigencomputation cost by O((p-1)^2) for sufficiently large problem sizes. Yet,\nin practical cases of moderate-size eigenproblems, the improvement rate\ndeteriorates as the number of computed eigenvalues increases because of\nmultiple matrix-vector and vector-vector operations. Our numerical tests show\nthat rIGA accelerates the solution of quadratic eigensystems by O(p-1) for\nmoderately sized problems when we seek to compute a reasonable number of\neigenvalues.\n"}

We also use complementary, high\nangular resolution and high-contrast images taken with PUEO at CFHT.

These variations are not due to the ~0.35-Msun stellar\ncompanion that we detected in imaging at more than 46 AU from the star. The\nabsence of correlation between the bisector velocity span variations and the\nradial velocity variations for this 7 km/s vsini star, as well as other\ncriteria indicate that the observed radial velocity variations are not due to\nstellar spots. The observed amplitude of the bisector velocity span variations\nalso seems to rule out stellar pulsations.

{"title": "DSCOVR: Randomized Primal-Dual Block Coordinate Algorithms for\n  Asynchronous Distributed Optimization", "trgt": "  Machine learning with big data often involves large optimization models. For\ndistributed optimization over a cluster of machines, frequent communication and\nsynchronization of all model parameters (optimization variables) can be very\ncostly. A promising solution is to use parameter servers to store different\nsubsets of the model parameters, and update them asynchronously at different\nmachines using local datasets. In this paper, we focus on distributed\noptimization of large linear models with convex loss functions, and propose a\nfamily of randomized primal-dual block coordinate algorithms that are\nespecially suitable for asynchronous distributed implementation with parameter\nservers. In particular, we work with the saddle-point formulation of such\nproblems which allows simultaneous data and model partitioning, and exploit its\nstructure by doubly stochastic coordinate optimization with variance reduction\n(DSCOVR). Compared with other first-order distributed algorithms, we show that\nDSCOVR may require less amount of overall computation and communication, and\nless or no synchronization. We discuss the implementation details of the DSCOVR\nalgorithms, and present numerical experiments on an industrial distributed\ncomputing system.\n"}
{"title": "Estimating dust attenuation from galactic spectra. I. methodology and\n  tests", "trgt": "  We develop a method to estimate the dust attenuation curve of galaxies from\nfull spectral fitting of their optical spectra. Motivated from previous\nstudies, we separate the small-scale features from the large-scale spectral\nshape, by performing a moving average method to both the observed spectrum and\nthe simple stellar population model spectra. The intrinsic dust-free model\nspectrum is then derived by fitting the observed ratio of the small-scale to\nlarge-scale (S/L) components with the S/L ratios of the SSP models. The\nselective dust attenuation curve is then determined by comparing the observed\nspectrum with the dust-free model spectrum. One important advantage of this\nmethod is that the estimated dust attenuation curve is independent of the shape\nof theoretical dust attenuation curves. We have done a series of tests on a set\nof mock spectra covering wide ranges of stellar age and metallicity. We show\nthat our method is able to recover the input dust attenuation curve accurately,\nalthough the accuracy depends slightly on signal-to-noise ratio of the spectra.\nWe have applied our method to a number of edge-on galaxies with obvious dust\nlanes from the ongoing MaNGA survey, deriving their dust attenuation curves and\n$E(B-V)$ maps, as well as dust-free images in $g$, $r$, and $i$ bands. These\ngalaxies show obvious dust lane features in their original images, which\nlargely disappear after we have corrected the effect of dust attenuation. The\nvertical brightness profiles of these galaxies become axis-symmetric and can\nwell be fitted by a simple model proposed for the disk vertical structure.\nComparing the estimated dust attenuation curve with the three commonly-adopted\nmodel curves, we find that the Calzetti curve provides the best description of\nthe estimated curves for the inner region of galaxies, while the Milky Way and\nSMC curves work better for the outer region.\n"}

{"title": "Generalization of the Ewens sampling formula to arbitrary fitness\n  landscapes", "trgt": "  In considering evolution of transcribed regions, regulatory modules, and\nother genomic loci of interest, we are often faced with a situation in which\nthe number of allelic states greatly exceeds the population size. In this\nlimit, the population eventually adopts a steady state characterized by\nmutation-selection-drift balance. Although new alleles continue to be explored\nthrough mutation, the statistics of the population, and in particular the\nprobabilities of seeing specific allelic configurations in samples taken from a\npopulation, do not change with time. In the absence of selection, probabilities\nof allelic configurations are given by the Ewens sampling formula, widely used\nin population genetics to detect deviations from neutrality. Here we develop an\nextension of this formula to arbitrary, possibly epistatic, fitness landscapes.\nAlthough our approach is general, we focus on the class of landscapes in which\nalleles are grouped into two, three, or several fitness states. This class of\nlandscapes yields sampling probabilities that are computationally more\ntractable, and can form a basis for the inference of selection signatures from\nsequence data. We demonstrate that, for a sizeable range of mutation rates and\nselection coefficients, the steady-state allelic diversity is not neutral.\nTherefore, it may be used to infer selection coefficients, as well as other key\nevolutionary parameters, using high-throughput sequencing of evolving\npopulations to collect data on locus polymorphisms. We also find that our\ntheory remains sufficiently accurate even if the assumptions such as the\ninfinite allele limit and the \"full connectivity\" assumption in which each\nallele can mutate into any other allele are relaxed. Thus, our framework\nestablishes a theoretical foundation for inferring selection signatures from\nsamples of sequences produced by evolution on epistatic fitness landscapes.\n"}
{"title": "BslA-stabilised emulsion droplets with designed microstructure", "trgt": "  Emulsions are a central component of many modern formulations in food,\npharmaceuticals, agrichemicals and personal care products. The droplets in\nthese formulations are limited to being spherical as a consequence of the\ninterfacial tension between the dispersed phase and continuous phase. The\nability to control emulsion droplet morphology and stabilise non-spherical\ndroplets would enable the modification of emulsion properties such as\nstability, substrate binding, delivery rate and rheology. One way of\ncontrolling droplet microstructure is to apply an elastic film around the\ndroplet to prevent it from relaxing into a sphere. We have previously shown\nthat BslA, an interfacial protein produced by the bacterial genus Bacillus,\nforms an elastic film when exposed to an oil- or air-water interface. Here, we\nhighlight BslA's ability to stabilise anisotropic emulsion droplets. First, we\nshow that BslA is capable of arresting dynamic emulsification processes leading\nto emulsions with variable morphologies depending on the conditions and\nemulsification technique applied. We then show that frozen emulsion droplets\ncan be manipulated to induce partial coalescence. The structure of the\npartially coalesced droplets is retained after melting, but only when there is\nsufficient free BslA in the continuous phase. That the fidelity of replication\ncan be tuned by adjusting the amount of free BslA in solution suggests that\nfreezing BslA-stabilised droplets disrupts the BslA film. Finally, we utilise\nBslA's ability to preserve emulsion droplet structural integrity throughout the\nmelting process to design emulsion droplets with a chosen shape and size.\n"}

In the\nabsence of impurities the model displays two types of collapsed phase, one of\nwhich is both anisotropically ordered and maximally dense (crystal-like). In\nthe presence of impurities the study showed that the crystal type phase\ndisappears.

Young neutron stars are\ninvolved in many of the possible scenarios for the origin of FRBs, and it has\nbeen suggested that the high dispersion measures observed in FRBs might be\nproduced by the ionized material in the ejecta of associated supernovae. Using\nVLA and VLBI measurements of the Type IIn SN 1986J, which has a central compact\ncomponent not so far seen in other supernovae, we can directly observe for the\nfirst time radio signals which originate in the interior of a young (~30 yr\nold) supernova.

By the time the ejecta have expanded so that\na 1-GHz signal would be visible, the internal dispersion measure due to the SN\nejecta would be below the values typically seen for FRBs. The high dispersion\nmeasures seen for the FRBs detected so far could of course be due to\npropagation through the intergalactic medium provided that the FRBs are at\ndistances much larger than that of SN 1986J, which is 10 Mpc.

This paper is primarily aimed at investigation of the Chandler wobble\n(CW) at the whole available 163-year interval to search for the major CW\namplitude and phase variations. First, the CW signal was extracted from the\nIERS (International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service) Pole\ncoordinates time series using two digital filters: the singular spectrum\nanalysis and Fourier transform. The CW amplitude and phase variations were\nexamined by means of the wavelet transform and Hilbert transform. Results of\nour analysis have shown that, besides the well-known CW phase jump in the\n1920s, two other large phase jumps have been found in the 1850s and 2000s. As\nin the 1920s, these phase jumps occurred contemporarily with a sharp decrease\nin the CW amplitude.\n"}

{"title": "Predicting synthetic rescues in metabolic networks", "trgt": "  An important goal of medical research is to develop methods to recover the\nloss of cellular function due to mutations and other defects. Many approaches\nbased on gene therapy aim to repair the defective gene or to insert genes with\ncompensatory function.

Focusing on the metabolism of single-cell organisms, we\ncomputationally study mutants that lack an essential enzyme, and thus are\nunable to grow or have a significantly reduced growth rate. We show that\nseveral of these mutants can be turned into viable organisms through additional\ngene deletions that restore their growth rate. In a rather counterintuitive\nfashion, this is achieved via additional damage to the metabolic network.

In slightly Ga-poor samples, probes were\nfound to strongly prefer one of two inequivalent Ga-sites. In slightly Ga-rich\nsamples at room temperature, 293 K, the PAC spectrum exhibited an unperturbed\nquadrupole interaction signal that is consistent with indium probes dissolved\nin small liquid pools of the excess Ga. A myriad of such pools are probably\nlocated along grain boundaries in the sample.

{"title": "Why are flare ribbons associated with the spines of magnetic null points\n  generically elongated?", "trgt": "  Coronal magnetic null points exist in abundance as demonstrated by\nextrapolations of the coronal field, and have been inferred to be important for\na broad range of energetic events. These null points and their associated\nseparatrix and spine field lines represent discontinuities of the field line\nmapping, making them preferential locations for reconnection. This field line\nmapping also exhibits strong gradients adjacent to the separatrix (fan) and\nspine field lines, that can be analysed using the `squashing factor', $Q$. In\nthis paper we make a detailed analysis of the distribution of $Q$ in the\npresence of magnetic nulls. While $Q$ is formally infinite on both the spine\nand fan of the null, the decay of $Q$ away from these structures is shown in\ngeneral to depend strongly on the null-point structure. For the generic case of\na non-radially-symmetric null, $Q$ decays most slowly away from the spine/fan\nin the direction in which $|{\\bf B}|$ increases most slowly. In particular,\nthis demonstrates that the extended, elliptical high-$Q$ halo around the spine\nfootpoints observed by Masson et al. (Astrophys. J., 700, 559, 2009) is a\ngeneric feature. This extension of the $Q$ halos around the spine/fan\nfootpoints is important for diagnosing the regions of the photosphere that are\nmagnetically connected to any current layer that forms at the null. In light of\nthis, we discuss how our results can be used to interpret the geometry of\nobserved flare ribbons in `circular ribbon flares', in which typically a\ncoronal null is implicated. We conclude that both the physics in the vicinity\nof the null and how this is related to the extension of $Q$ away from the\nspine/fan can be used in tandem to understand observational signatures of\nreconnection at coronal null points.\n"}

This is not trivial, due to the variation in the shape and\nwidth of the Point Spread Function (PSF) introduced by wavelength differences,\ninstrument positions and atmospheric conditions. Current methods to correct for\nthis effect rely on a detailed knowledge of the PSF characteristics as a\nfunction of the survey coordinates, which can be difficult due to the relative\npaucity of stars tracking the PSF behaviour. Here we show that it is possible\nto measure accurate, consistent multicolour photometry without knowing the\nshape of PSF. The Chebyshev-Fourier Functions (CHEFs) can fit the observed\nprofile of each object and produce high signal-to-noise integrated flux\nmeasurements unaffected by the PSF. These total fluxes, which encompass all the\ngalaxy populations, are much more useful for Galaxy Evolution studies than\naperture photometry.

In a sense, such a protocol realizes a trusted oracle\nthat computes $f$ and returns the result to both parties. There have been\ntremendous strides in efficiency over the past ten years, yet 2P-SFE protocols\nremain impractical for most real-time, online computations, particularly on\nmodestly provisioned devices. Intel's Software Guard Extensions (SGX) provides\nhardware-protected execution environments, called enclaves, that may be viewed\nas trusted computation oracles. While SGX provides native CPU speed for secure\ncomputation, previous side-channel and micro-architecture attacks have\ndemonstrated how security guarantees of enclaves can be compromised.\n  In this paper, we explore a balanced approach to 2P-SFE on SGX-enabled\nprocessors by constructing a protocol for evaluating $f$ relative to a\npartitioning of $f$. This approach alleviates the burden of trust on the\nenclave by allowing the protocol designer to choose which components should be\nevaluated within the enclave, and which via standard cryptographic techniques.\nWe describe SGX-enabled SFE protocols (modeling the enclave as an oracle), and\nformalize the strongest-possible notion of 2P-SFE for our setting. We prove our\nprotocol meets this notion when properly realized. We implement the protocol\nand apply it to two practical problems: privacy-preserving queries to a\ndatabase, and a version of Dijkstra's algorithm for privacy-preserving\nnavigation. Our evaluation shows that our SGX-enabled SFE scheme enjoys a 38x\nincrease in performance over garbled-circuit-based SFE. Finally, we justify\nmodeling of the enclave as an oracle by implementing protections against known\nside-channels.\n"}

From those closed formulas, we can\ndetermine the underlying symmetry types of the families. The one-level scaling\ndensity for the first family corresponds to the orthogonal distribution as\npredicted by the conjectures of Katz and Sarnak, and the one-level scaling\ndensity for the second family is the sum of the Dirac distribution and the even\northogonal distribution. This seems to be a new phenomenon, caused by the fact\nthat the curves of the second families have odd rank. Then, there is a trivial\nzero at the central point which accounts for the Dirac distribution, and also\naffects the remaining part of the scaling density which is then (maybe\nsurprisingly) the even orthogonal distribution. The one-level density for this\nsecond family was studied in the past for test functions with Fourier\ntransforms of small support, but since the Fourier transforms of the even\northogonal and odd orthogonal distributions are undistinguishable for small\nsupport, it was not possible to identify the distribution with those\ntechniques.

{"title": "Bias-Limited Extraction of Cosmological Parameters", "trgt": "  It is known that modeling uncertainties and astrophysical foregrounds can\npotentially introduce appreciable bias in the deduced values of cosmological\nparameters. While it is commonly assumed that these uncertainties will be\naccounted for to a sufficient level of precision, the level of bias has not\nbeen properly quantified in most cases of interest. We show that the\nrequirement that the bias in derived values of cosmological parameters does not\nsurpass nominal statistical error, translates into a maximal level of overall\nerror $O(N^{-1/2})$ on $|\\Delta P(k)|/P(k)$ and $|\\Delta C_{l}|/C_{l}$, where\n$P(k)$, $C_{l}$, and $N$ are the matter power spectrum, angular power spectrum,\nand number of (independent Fourier) modes at a given scale $l$ or $k$ probed by\nthe cosmological survey, respectively. This required level has important\nconsequences on the precision with which cosmological parameters are hoped to\nbe determined by future surveys: In virtually all ongoing and near future\nsurveys $N$ typically falls in the range $10^{6}-10^{9}$, implying that the\nrequired overall theoretical modeling and numerical precision is already very\nhigh.

Such vulnerability makes it risky for some\nsecurity-related applications (e.g., semantic segmentation in autonomous cars)\nand triggers tremendous concerns on the model reliability. For the first time,\nwe comprehensively evaluate the robustness of existing UDA methods and propose\na robust UDA approach. It is rooted in two observations: (i) the robustness of\nUDA methods in semantic segmentation remains unexplored, which pose a security\nconcern in this field; and (ii) although commonly used self-supervision (e.g.,\nrotation and jigsaw) benefits image tasks such as classification and\nrecognition, they fail to provide the critical supervision signals that could\nlearn discriminative representation for segmentation tasks. These observations\nmotivate us to propose adversarial self-supervision UDA (or ASSUDA) that\nmaximizes the agreement between clean images and their adversarial examples by\na contrastive loss in the output space. Extensive empirical studies on commonly\nused benchmarks demonstrate that ASSUDA is resistant to adversarial attacks.\n"}

Any values that are unchanged over the grayscale images\nlook the same in the color image.

In the case of strontium titanate\nwith low carrier concentration, unconventional superconductivity and\nferroelectricity were shown to be correlated. Here, we report theoretically and\nexperimentally evaluated Gr\\\"uneisen parameters whose divergence under tensile\nstress indicates that the dominant phonon mode that enhances the\nsuperconducting order is the ferroelectric transverse soft-mode. This finding\nrules out all other phonon modes as the main contributors to the enhanced\nsuperconductivity in strained strontium titanate.

We show the breakdown of approximate relation for\nthe Keplerian frequency derived by Lattimer and Prakash [Science, 304, 536,\n(2004)] and then we present a new, EOS-independent and more accurate relation.\nThis relation fits the Keplerian frequency of rotating neutron stars to about\n$2\\%$ for a large range of the compactness $M_{S}/R_{S}$ of the reference\nnon-rotating neutron star, namely the static star with the same central density\nas the rotating one. The performance of the fitting formula is close to $4\\%$\nfor $M_{S}/R_{S}\\leq 0.05~M_{\\odot}$/km ($f_{K}\\leq 350$~Hz).

We show that as a\nresult of the O2 plasma steps in PEALD of SiO2, the top surface of the\nunderlying Ni electrode is oxidized. Additionally, the bottom surface of the\nupper Ni layer is also oxidized where it is in contact with the deposited SiO2,\nmost likely as a result of oxygen-containing species on the surface of the\nSiO2. Due to the presence of these surface parasitic layers of NiO, which\nexhibit features typical of thermally activated transport, the resistance of\nNi-SiO2-Ni tunnel junctions is drastically increased. Moreover, the transport\nmechanism is changed from quantum tunneling through the dielectric barrier to\none consistent with thermally activated resistors in series with tunnel\njunctions. The reduction of NiO to Ni is therefore required to restore the\nmetal-insulator-metal (MIM) structure of the junctions. Rapid thermal annealing\nin a forming gas ambient at elevated temperatures is presented as a technique\nto reduce both parasitic oxide layers.

We utilise medial\naxis technology to robustly partition the near-field into blocks which can be\nmeshed coarsely with a linear swept mesher. A high-order mesh of the near-field\nis then generated and split using an isoparametric approach which allows us to\nobtain highly stretched elements aligned with the flow field. Special treatment\nof the partition is performed on the wing root juntion and the trailing edge\n--- into the wake --- to obtain an H-type mesh configuration with anisotropic\nhexahedra ideal for the strong shear of high Reynolds number simulations. We\nthen proceed to discretise the far-field using traditional robust tetrahedral\nmeshing tools.

One of the main\nproblems in VLC is the limited dynamic range of LEDs and their nonlinear\nresponse, which may lead to a severe degradation in the communication, and more\nspecifically in the bit error rate (BER). This is aggravated by the extensive\nusage of multicarrier multiplexing, based on optical orthogonal frequency\ndivision multiplexing (O-OFDM), characterized by a high peak-to-average power\nratio. Here, we present a chaos-based coded modulation (CCM) setup specifically\nadapted to the LED nonlinearities.

{"title": "Learning with Noisy Labels via Sparse Regularization", "trgt": "  Learning with noisy labels is an important and challenging task for training\naccurate deep neural networks. Some commonly-used loss functions, such as Cross\nEntropy (CE), suffer from severe overfitting to noisy labels. Robust loss\nfunctions that satisfy the symmetric condition were tailored to remedy this\nproblem, which however encounter the underfitting effect. In this paper, we\ntheoretically prove that \\textbf{any loss can be made robust to noisy labels}\nby restricting the network output to the set of permutations over a fixed\nvector. When the fixed vector is one-hot, we only need to constrain the output\nto be one-hot, which however produces zero gradients almost everywhere and thus\nmakes gradient-based optimization difficult. In this work, we introduce the\nsparse regularization strategy to approximate the one-hot constraint, which is\ncomposed of network output sharpening operation that enforces the output\ndistribution of a network to be sharp and the $\\ell_p$-norm ($p\\le 1$)\nregularization that promotes the network output to be sparse. This simple\napproach guarantees the robustness of arbitrary loss functions while not\nhindering the fitting ability. Experimental results demonstrate that our method\ncan significantly improve the performance of commonly-used loss functions in\nthe presence of noisy labels and class imbalance, and outperform the\nstate-of-the-art methods.

{"title": "Practical Comparison of Optimization Algorithms for Learning-Based MPC\n  with Linear Models", "trgt": "  Learning-based control methods are an attractive approach for addressing\nperformance and efficiency challenges in robotics and automation systems. One\nsuch technique that has found application in these domains is learning-based\nmodel predictive control (LBMPC). An important novelty of LBMPC lies in the\nfact that its robustness and stability properties are independent of the type\nof online learning used. This allows the use of advanced statistical or machine\nlearning methods to provide the adaptation for the controller. This paper is\nconcerned with providing practical comparisons of different optimization\nalgorithms for implementing the LBMPC method, for the special case where the\ndynamic model of the system is linear and the online learning provides linear\nupdates to the dynamic model. For comparison purposes, we have implemented a\nprimal-dual infeasible start interior point method that exploits the sparsity\nstructure of LBMPC. Our open source implementation (called LBmpcIPM) is\navailable through a BSD license and is provided freely to enable the rapid\nimplementation of LBMPC on other platforms. This solver is compared to the\ndense active set solvers LSSOL and qpOASES using a quadrotor helicopter\nplatform. Two scenarios are considered: The first is a simulation comparing\nhovering control for the quadrotor, and the second is on-board control\nexperiments of dynamic quadrotor flight. Though the LBmpcIPM method has better\nasymptotic computational complexity than LSSOL and qpOASES, we find that for\ncertain integrated systems (like our quadrotor testbed) these methods can\noutperform LBmpcIPM. This suggests that actual benchmarks should be used when\nchoosing which algorithm is used to implement LBMPC on practical systems.\n"}
{"title": "An Energy Stable Finite-Difference Scheme for Functionalized\n  Cahn-Hilliard Equation and its Convergence Analysis", "trgt": "  We present and analyze an unconditionally energy stable and convergent finite\ndifference scheme for the Functionalized Cahn-Hilliard equation. One key\ndifficulty associated with the energy stability is based on the fact that one\nnonlinear energy functional term in the expansion appears as non-convex,\nnon-concave. To overcome this subtle difficulty, we add two auxiliary terms to\nmake the combined term convex, which in turns yields a convex-concave\ndecomposition of the physical energy. As a result, an application of the convex\nsplitting methodology assures both the unique solvability and the unconditional\nenergy stability of the proposed numerical scheme. To deal with a 4-Laplacian\nsolver in an $H^{-1}$ gradient flow at each time step, we apply an efficient\npreconditioned steepest descent algorithm to solve the corresponding nonlinear\nsystems. In addition, a global in time $H_{\\rm per}^2$ stability of the\nnumerical scheme is established at a theoretical level, which in turn ensures\nthe full order convergence analysis of the scheme. A few numerical results are\npresented, which confirm the stability and accuracy of the proposed numerical\nscheme.\n"}

Infrared reflectivity spectroscopy was performed at temperatures\nfrom 5 to 900 K for the ceramics and below room temperature for the thin film.\nAll 13 polar phonons allowed by the factor-group analysis were observed in\ntheceramic samples. The thin-film spectra revealed 12 phonon modes only and an\nadditional weak excitation, probably of spin origin.

We demonstrate how dedicated\ncalibration data from a small subset of NIRSpec modes and apertures can be used\nto optimize this parametric model to the necessary levels of fidelity.

Considering the depth\nof the NaD lines found by Davidge (2018a), the deep NaI2.21um lines are\ntentatively attributed to a bottom-heavy mass function.

By analysing the correlation and spectral functions via\nexponential fits and the Maximum Entropy Method respectively, we have found\nparity doubling for the nucleon and $\\Delta$ baryon channels in the QGP phase.\nFor the $\\Omega$ baryon we see a clear signal of parity doubling at the\ncrossover temperature, which is however not complete, due to the nonzero\nstrange quark mass. Moreover, in-medium effects in the hadronic phase are\nevident for all three baryons, in particular for the negative-parity ground\nstates. This might have implications for the hadron resonance gas model. In\nthis work we used the FASTSUM anisotropic $N_f = 2 + 1$ ensembles.\n"}

It is proved that much\nlarger sub-areas of the images can be used for the fit, while keeping the same\naccuracy in the subtracted image. This result is especially important in case\nof variables located in low density fields, like the Huchra lens. Many other\nuseful applications of the method are possible for major astrophysical\nproblems. For instance supernovas search should benefit the method, but other\napplications like Cepheids surveys in other galaxies should also find some\nadvantage in using the method.

We assume\nas before that space-time is the product of a four-dimensional manifold by a\nfinite noncommmutative space F. The spectral action is the pure gravitational\naction for the product space. To remove the above arbitrariness, we classify\nthe irreducibe geometries F consistent with imposing reality and chiral\nconditions on spinors, to avoid the fermion doubling problem, which amounts to\nhave total dimension 10 (in the K-theoretic sense). It gives, almost uniquely,\nthe Standard Model with all its details, predicting the number of fermions per\ngeneration to be 16, their representations and the Higgs breaking mechanism,\nwith very little input. The geometrical model is valid at the unification\nscale, and has relations connecting the gauge couplings to each other and to\nthe Higgs coupling. This gives a prediction of the Higgs mass of around 170 GeV\nand a mass relation connecting the sum of the square of the masses of the\nfermions to the W mass square, which enables us to predict the top quark mass\ncompatible with the measured experimental value. We thus manage to have the\nadvantages of both SO(10) and Kaluza-Klein unification, without paying the\nprice of plethora of Higgs fields or the infinite tower of states.\n"}

This is important given the cost of\nlearning such representations. Ideally, we would prefer representations that do\nnot need to be trained again when transferring to a different task, while\nretaining reasonable performance.\n  In this work, we propose a holistic evaluation protocol for entity\nrepresentations learned via a link prediction objective.

The line is extremely\nbroad (FWHM 735 km/s) and seems to have a flat-topped or double-peaked line\nprofile. A velocity map of the line shows a gradient across the source that\nindicates large-scale rotation of star-forming gas. Together, the velocity map\nand line profile suggest the presence of a massive rotating disc with a\ndynamical mass M_dyn > 5x10^10 M_sun. Using the assumption of a rotating disc\norigin, we employ an empirical relation between galaxy disc circular velocity\nand bulge velocity dispersion (sigma) to estimate that sigma > 310 km/s,\nsubject to a correction for the unknown disc inclination. This result implies\nthat this source is consistent with the local M--sigma relation, or offset at\nmost by an order of magnitude in black hole mass.

The dominant term in the asymptotic\nexpansion is expressed as an infinite series in terms of the eigenvalues\n$\\{\\lambda_n\\}_{n\\in \\mathbb{N}}$ of the Newtonian operator (for the pure\nLaplacian). Such expansions are useful under a certain scale between the size\nof the particles and their contrast. Second, we observe that the relevant\neigenvalues appearing in the expansion have non-zero averaged eigenfunctions.\nWe prove that the family $\\{\\sin(\\frac{c_1}{\\sqrt{\\lambda_n}}\\, t),\\,\n\\cos(\\frac{c_1}{\\sqrt{\\lambda_n}}\\, t)\\}$, for those relevant eigenvalues, with\n$c_1$ as the contrast of the small particle, defines a Riesz basis (contrary to\nthe family corresponding to the whole sequence of eigenvalues).

The survey, conducted with the BIMA interferometer, covers the\nstellar disk and a large fraction of the extended HI envelope with the\nsensitivity and resolution necessary to detect individual giant molecular\nclouds (GMCs) at the distance of IC 10 (950 kpc). We find 16 clouds with a\ntotal CO luminosity of 1 x 10^6 K km s^-1 pc^2, equivalent to 4 x 10^6 Msun of\nmolecular gas using the Galactic CO-to-H2 conversion factor. Observations with\nthe ARO 12m find that BIMA may resolve out as much as 50% of the CO emission,\nand we estimate the total CO luminosity as 2.2 x 10^6 K km s^-1 pc^2. We\nmeasure the properties of 14 GMCs from high resolution OVRO data. These clouds\nare very similar to Galactic GMCs in their sizes, line widths, luminosities,\nand CO-to-H2 conversion factors despite the low metallicity of IC 10 (Z ~ 1/5\nZsun). Comparing the BIMA survey to the atomic gas and stellar content of IC 10\nwe find that most of the CO emission is coincident with high surface density\nHI. IC 10 displays a much higher star formation rate per unit molecular (H2) or\ntotal (HI+H2) gas than most galaxies. This could be a real difference or may be\nan evolutionary effect - the star formation rate may have been higher in the\nrecent past.\n"}

Since iron is the most used metal in the\nworld, reinforcing iron with graphene can reduce the overall requirement of\nmaterial in any application where strength is demanded. However, the effect of\ngraphene reinforcement on the mechanical properties of iron needs to be known\nbefore the industrial application of the composite. In this paper, we have\ninvestigated the mechanical properties of graphene-reinforced iron composite by\nMolecular Dynamics (MD) method for various conditions. The properties were\ninvestigated by applying uniaxial tension on a modeled representative volume\nelement (RVE). The effect of temperature on the mechanical property of the\ncomposite was also studied because the knowledge is required for manufacturing\nproducts with the composite operating at a wide temperature range. MD analysis\nalso revealed that the initiation of fracture is from the matrix-fiber\ninterface. We also investigated how the distance of vacancy defects from the\nmatrix-fiber interface affects the mechanical properties of the composite,\nwhich can be used to select a suitable manufacturing process. The results\nobtained from this study show that vacancy defects lower the strength at a\ngreater extent as it gets closer to the interface.\n"}

However, these post-hoc\nexplanations may not always be faithful to classifier predictions, which poses\na significant challenge when attempting to debug models based on such\nexplanations. To this end, we seek a methodology that can improve the\nfaithfulness of an explanation method with respect to model predictions which\ndoes not require ground truth explanations. We achieve this through a novel\nexplanation-driven data augmentation (EDDA) technique that augments the\ntraining data with occlusions inferred from model explanations; this is based\non the simple motivating principle that \\emph{if} the explainer is faithful to\nthe model \\emph{then} occluding salient regions for the model prediction should\ndecrease the model confidence in the prediction, while occluding non-salient\nregions should not change the prediction. To verify that the proposed\naugmentation method has the potential to improve faithfulness, we evaluate EDDA\nusing a variety of datasets and classification models. We demonstrate\nempirically that our approach leads to a significant increase of faithfulness,\nwhich can facilitate better debugging and successful deployment of image\nclassification models in real-world applications.\n"}

{"title": "Fast plurality consensus in regular expanders", "trgt": "  Pull voting is a classic method to reach consensus among $n$ vertices with\ndiffering opinions in a distributed network: each vertex at each step takes on\nthe opinion of a random neighbour.

In the two-sample protocol a vertex updates its\nopinion only if both sampled opinions are the same. Not much was known about\nthe performance of two-sample voting on general expanders in the case of three\nor more opinions.

We construct the Kormendy relation (KR),\nFaber-Jackson relation (FJR) and colour-magnitude relation (CMR) for early-type\ngalaxies in Abell 1689 using this data and compare them to those of the Coma\ncluster. We measure the intrinsic scatter of the CMR in Abell 1689 to be 0.054\n\\pm 0.004 mag which places degenerate constraints on the ratio of the assembly\ntimescale to the time available (beta) and the age of the population. Making\nthe assumption that galaxies in Abell 1689 will evolve into those of Coma over\nan interval of 2.26 Gyr breaks this degeneracy and limits beta to be > 0.6 and\nthe age of the red sequence to be > 5.5 Gyr (formed at z > 0.55). Without\ncorrections for size evolution but accounting for magnitude cuts and selection\neffects, the KR & FJR are inconsistent and disagree at the 2 sigma level\nregarding the amount of luminosity evolution in the last 2.26 Gyr.

We\nfind an inclination of i =23.0 plus or minus 0.8 and PAlon = 163.7 plus or\nminus 1.5 for the LMC disk using the OGLE III data and an inclination of i=37.4\nplus or minus 2.3 and PAlon= 141.2 plus or minus 3.7 for the LMC disk using the\nMCPS data. The effect of choice of center, reddening and area covered on the\nestimated parameters are discussed. Regions in the north west, south west and\nsouth east of the LMC disk are warped with respect to the fitted plane. We also\nidentify a symmetric but offcentered warp in the inner LMC.We identify that the\nstructure of the LMC disk inside the 3 degree radius is different from the\noutside disk such that the inner LMC has relatively less inclination and\nrelatively large PAlon. The 3D plot of the LMC disk suggests an offcentered\nincrease in the inclination for the north-eastern regions which might be due to\ntidal effects. We suggest that the variation in the planar parameters estimated\nby various authors as well as in this study is because of the difference in\ncoverage and the complicated inner structure of the LMC disk. In the inner LMC,\nthe stellar and HI disk are found to have similar properties.\n"}

The derivation is via\nthe method of relative weights, and the theories are solved at finite chemical\npotential by mean field theory. We find in some instances that the long-range\ncouplings in the effective action are very important to the phase structure,\nand that these couplings are responsible for long-lived metastable states in\nthe effective theory. Only one of these states corresponds to the underlying\nlattice gauge theory.\n"}
{"title": "RetainVis: Visual Analytics with Interpretable and Interactive Recurrent\n  Neural Networks on Electronic Medical Records", "trgt": "  We have recently seen many successful applications of recurrent neural\nnetworks (RNNs) on electronic medical records (EMRs), which contain histories\nof patients' diagnoses, medications, and other various events, in order to\npredict the current and future states of patients. Despite the strong\nperformance of RNNs, it is often challenging for users to understand why the\nmodel makes a particular prediction. Such black-box nature of RNNs can impede\nits wide adoption in clinical practice. Furthermore, we have no established\nmethods to interactively leverage users' domain expertise and prior knowledge\nas inputs for steering the model. Therefore, our design study aims to provide a\nvisual analytics solution to increase interpretability and interactivity of\nRNNs via a joint effort of medical experts, artificial intelligence scientists,\nand visual analytics researchers. Following the iterative design process\nbetween the experts, we design, implement, and evaluate a visual analytics tool\ncalled RetainVis, which couples a newly improved, interpretable and interactive\nRNN-based model called RetainEX and visualizations for users' exploration of\nEMR data in the context of prediction tasks. Our study shows the effective use\nof RetainVis for gaining insights into how individual medical codes contribute\nto making risk predictions, using EMRs of patients with heart failure and\ncataract symptoms. Our study also demonstrates how we made substantial changes\nto the state-of-the-art RNN model called RETAIN in order to make use of\ntemporal information and increase interactivity. This study will provide a\nuseful guideline for researchers that aim to design an interpretable and\ninteractive visual analytics tool for RNNs.\n"}
{"title": "Field distribution analysis in deflecting structures", "trgt": "  Deflecting structures are used now manly for bunch rotation in emittance\nexchange concepts, bunch diagnostics and to increase the luminosity. The bunch\nrotation is a transformation of a particles distribution in the six dimensional\nphase space. Together with the expected transformations, deflecting structures\nintroduce distortions due to particularities - aberrations - in the deflecting\nfield distribution. The distributions of deflecting fields are considered with\nrespect to non linear additions, which provide emittance deteriorations during\na transformation. The deflecting field is treated as combination of hybrid\nwaves HE 1 and HM_1. The criteria for selection and formation of deflecting\nstructures with minimized level of aberrations are formulated and applied to\nknown structures.

{"title": "A BCG with offset cooling: is the AGN feedback cycle broken in A2495?", "trgt": "  We present a combined radio/X-ray analysis of the poorly studied galaxy\ncluster Abell 2495 (z=0.07923) based on new EVLA and Chandra data. We also\nanalyze and discuss Halpha emission and optical continuum data retrieved from\nthe literature. We find an offset of 6 kpc between the cluster BCG\n(MCG+02-58-021) and the peak of the X-ray emission, suggesting that the cooling\nprocess is not taking place on the central galaxy nucleus. We propose that\nsloshing of the ICM could be responsible for this separation. Furthermore, we\ndetect a second, 4 kpc offset between the peak of the Halpha emission and that\nof the X-ray emission. Optical images highlight the presence of a dust filament\nextending up to 6 kpc in the cluster BCG, and allow us to estimate a dust mass\nwithin the central 7 kpc of 1.7e+5 Msun. Exploiting the dust to gas ratio and\nthe L_Halpha-M_mol relation, we argue that a significant amount (up to 10^9\nMsun) of molecular gas should be present in the BCG of this cluster. We also\ninvestigate the presence of ICM depressions, finding two putative systems of\ncavities; the inner pair is characterized by t age = 18 Myr and P cav = 1.2e+43\nerg/s, the outer one by t age = 53 Myr and P cav = 5.6e+42 erg/s. Their age\ndifference appears to be consistent with the free-fall time of the central\ncooling gas and with the offset timescale estimated with the Halpha kinematic\ndata, suggesting that sloshing is likely playing a key role in this\nenvironment. Furthermore, the cavities' power analysis shows that the AGN\nenergy injection is able to sustain the feedback cycle, despite cooling being\noffset from the BCG nucleus.\n"}

In the case of a bounded\nand symmetric uncertainty region, we show that the power allocation problem for\neach user is simplified, and can be solved in a distributed manner. We derive\nthe conditions for RNE's uniqueness and for convergence of the distributed\nalgorithm; and show that the total throughput (social utility) is less than\nthat at NE when RNE is unique. We also show that for multiple RNEs, the social\nutility may be higher at a RNE as compared to that at the corresponding NE, and\ndemonstrate that this is caused by users' orthogonal utilization of bandwidth\nat RNE.

Another one is to select\nequilibria that are included in the support of the zero noise limit of the\nmean-field game with common noise. A last one is to select equilibria supported\nby the limit of the mean-field component of the corresponding $N$-player game\nas the number of players goes to infinity. The contribution of this paper is to\nshow that, for the class under study, the last two approaches select the same\nequilibria, but the first approach selects another one.\n"}

Taken with a 16-month interval, the Chandra and\nXMM-Newton spectra are very similar. They reveal a very rich absorption line\nspectrum from the hot white dwarf photosphere, but no spectral signatures of a\nwind. We also report a third X-ray off-state during a later Chandra\nobservation, demonstrating the recurrent nature of CAL 83. Moreover, we found\nevidence of short-timescale variability in the soft X-ray spectrum. We\ncompleted the analysis of the LETG and RGS spectra of CAL 83 with new NLTE\nline-blanketed model atmospheres that explicitly include 74 ions of the 11 most\nabundant species. We successfully matched the Chandra and XMM-Newton spectra\nassuming a model composition with LMC metallicity. We derived the basic stellar\nparameters of the hot white dwarf, but the current state of atomic data in the\nsoft X-ray domain precludes a detailed chemical analysis. We have obtained the\nfirst direct spectroscopic evidence that the white dwarf is massive (Mwd > 1\nMsun). The short timescale of the X-ray off-states is consistent with a high\nwhite dwarf mass.

{"title": "Estimating Black Hole Masses in Active Galaxies Using the Halpha\n  Emission Line", "trgt": "  It has been established that virial masses for black holes in low-redshift\nactive galaxies can be estimated from measurements of the optical continuum\nstrength and the width of the broad Hbeta line.

To mitigate these difficulties, we\npresent a new method for estimating black hole masses. From analysis of a new\nsample of broad-line active galactic nuclei, we find that Halpha luminosity\nscales almost linearly with optical continuum luminosity and that a strong\ncorrelation exists between Halpha and Hbeta line widths. These two empirical\ncorrelations allow us to translate the standard virial mass system to a new one\nbased solely on observations of the broad Halpha emission line.\n"}
