Extract key facts and details from a paragraph and generate a set of questions that help an editor to reconstruct the paragraph's content as accurately as possible.

Requirements:
- Ensure all key factual content (names, dates, places, relationships, events) is captured in the questions.
- Avoid subjective or stylistic elementsâ€”focus on objective details.
- Ensure each question is self-contained, independent and mutually exclusive, pertaining to a single information only. 
- Always refer to the full name or subject (e.g., do not refer to 'the film').
- Do not refer to 'the paragraph' or include 'according to the paragraph'.

Generate at least {min_cp} chronological questions that and return them as a Python list [question1, question2, ...] without extra text or explanations. Paragraph from the Wikipedia article "{page_title}" section "{section_title}":
