In addition, Boston in the 1920s censored other novels such as The American Mercury, Elmer Gantry, An American Tragedy, Strange Interlude, and Lady Chatterley’s Lover. The rise of censorship in Boston aroused local opposition. The Harvard Crimson in 1929 wrote, \"it has become so tiresome to reproach Boston for their constant repression of creative work, that we are beginning to surrender in despair.\" The Boston censors countered that the censorship was justified because according to the U. S. federal political system, it is the duty of the states to implant their educational policies.", "mgt": "Book censorship in the United States began in the mid-19th century. One of the earliest publicized cases in America was the banning of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species in Trinity College. The book contains Darwin's theory of evolution and was also banned in other parts of America, such as Tennessee, in the early 20th century. In Boston in the 1920s, books such as A Farewell to Arms by Ernest Hemingway and The American Mercury were censored. The controversies surrounding these works led to complaints from people in the area. The Harvard Crimson wrote in 1929, \"it has become so tiresome to reproach Boston for their constant repression of creative work, that we are beginning to surrender in despair.\" The Boston censorship was justified according to the U.S. federal political system, as it is the duty of the states to implement their educational policies. Opponents, however, argue that this censorship hinders both freedom of speech and the development of intellectual ideas."}

Since 2021, IPOB and other Biafran separatist groups have been fighting a low-level guerilla conflict in southeastern Nigeria against the Nigerian government. The group was founded in 2012 by Nnamdi Kanu, a British Nigerian political activist known for his advocacy of the contemporary Biafran independence movement. It was deemed a terrorist organization by the Nigerian government in 2017 under the Nigerian Terrorism Act. As of May 2022, the United Kingdom started denying asylum to members of IPOB who engaged in human rights abuses, though the U. K. government clarified that IPOB had not been designated as a terrorist organisation.", "mgt": "The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) is a nationalist Self-determination group in Nigeria, founded in 2012 by Nnamdi Kanu, a British-Biafran political activist, with the aim of self-determination for the restoration of the Republic of Biafra, a position similar to that taken by the original Biafran Separatist Movement before the Nigerian Civil War. The group aims to be recognized as an independent state and has been active in the region of southeastern Nigeria since 2012. The allegations of genocide against Biafrans during the Nigerian Civil War have been made by the movement, but this allegation is disputed by the Nigerian government. Since 2021, IPOB and other Biafran self-determination groups have been involved in conflict with the Nigerian government. In 2017, the Nigerian government designated IPOB as a terrorist organization and has taken actions to suppress the movement, but as of May 2022, the United Kingdom has began granting asylum to members of IPOB who qualify as persecuted indigenous people of Biafra. The U.K. government has not designated IPOB as a terrorist organization."}

The transfer of power from the bourgeoisie to the proletariat is seen as making it possible to develop socialism. In contrast to other socialist political parties, Lenin proposed that a revolutionary vanguard party, primarily drawn from the working class, should lead the political campaign for socialist changes to society, rather than the economist campaign of labour strikes for increased wages and work concessions. Lenin also distinguished the aspects of a revolution, with the \"economic campaign\" featuring diffused, plural leadership, and the \"political campaign\" requiring the decisive leadership of the Bolshevik vanguard party."}

The US boxing team surprised everyone, advancing to six gold medal bouts and winning five of them, drawing parallels to a stellar 1952 team that also took five golds. The achievement was even more notable due to the fact that the American boxers were significantly younger and less experienced than their Cuban and Soviet counterparts. In other sports, US divers won five medals, including two golds; the US equestrian team took home four medals; American shooters won three medals, including a historic silver by a woman in the mixed 50 meters rifle three positions; US freestyle wrestlers advanced to four gold medal bouts, yet won only one of them (all four were against the Soviets), concluding the meet with six medals overall.", "mgt": "The 1976 Montreal Olympics had contrasting results for various countries. Seven Eastern Bloc countries placed in the top ten of the medal table. The United States team finished third in the medal standings for the first time in its history. Some sources suggest that Eastern Bloc countries, including the Soviet Union and East Germany, used doping systems and professional athletes, which led to their success. The US men's swimming team performed exceptionally well, winning 12 gold medals and shattering 11 world records. However, the US women's swimming team struggled against the dominant East German doping program, even managing to win a gold medal in the 4x100 freestyle relay. This victory is often considered one of the most improbable and heroic upsets of all time. The US boxing team surprised many by advancing to six gold medal bouts and winning five of them, although they faced stiff competition from rivals such as Cuba and the Soviet Union. US divers won five medals, the equestrian team took four, shooters won three and freestyle wrestlers won six. These results demonstrate the significant competition at the Games. Some sources have argued that the East Bloc's dominance was largely due to their doping programs, but other factors such as training and experience also played a role in the success of these countries. The aim of this encyclopedia entry is to provide factual information about the Olympic Games and not to engage in disputes or promote particular interpretations of events."}

Flat-shod horses wear regular horseshoes, displaying natural movement. Sored horses are equipped with built-up pads or \"stacks\" alongside other weighted devices, creating the \"Big Lick\" distortion. While stacks and agony devices are prohibited by the Horse Protection Act of 1970, they are still used in shows sanctioned by the United States Equestrian Federation and some breed organizations. This practice of soring, deemed inhumane, leads to abusive treatment of horses and has been the source of controversy within the breed community, resulting in the creation of separate breed organizations, as well as criminal charges against several individuals.
