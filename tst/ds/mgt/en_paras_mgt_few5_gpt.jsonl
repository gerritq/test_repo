Lebailly concludes that it has been an error of Dodgson's biographers to view his child-photography with 20th or 21st century eyes, and to have presented it as some form of personal idiosyncrasy, when it was in fact a response to a prevalent aesthetic and philosophical movement of the time. Lebailly's theory can be viewed at.", "mgt": "Recent studies, particularly by Hugues Lebailly, have sought to contextualize Dodgson's child photography within the \"Victorian Child Cult,\" which viewed child nudity as an expression of innocence. Lebailly notes that studies of child nudes were common and accepted during Dodgson's time, with many photographers, including Oscar Rejlander and Julia Margaret Cameron, producing such images regularly. He also mentions that child nudes appeared on Victorian Christmas cards, suggesting a different social and aesthetic perspective on this material. Lebailly argues that it has been a misinterpretation by Dodgson's biographers to assess his child photography through a 20th or 21st-century lens, rather than recognizing it as a response to a prevalent aesthetic and philosophical movement of his era. Lebailly's work on the subject is available for further review."}

The invasion faced criticism both within Israel and internationally, particularly after the Sabra and Shatila massacre, and resulted in significant casualties among the Lebanese population. The invasion led to Arafat's exile to Tunisia and entangled Israel with various local Palestinian groups, including Hezbollah, which sought to end the Israeli occupation. By 1985, Israel had retreated from most of Lebanon but continued to occupy a stretch of territory known as the Israeli Security Zone, which the UN Security Council Resolution 425 addressed, confirming that Israel had to withdraw its forces by June 16, 2000."}

The United States team was relegated to a third place in the medal standings for the first time in its history, courtesy of Soviet and East German doping systems and their use of professional athletes. This was the Olympics of contrasts: the US men's swimming team, despite a generally dismal showing of the delegation, obliterated their sport, sweeping 12 gold and 27 total medals in the 13 events that were on the program and shattering 11 world records in the process (this was arguably the most dominant performance of any swimming team in history), while the US women's swimming team, on the other hand, fell victim to the unbeatable East German dopers. They still managed to win a gold medal, in a shocking upset against East Germans in the 4x100 freestyle relay. The event was held on the last day of the swimming program, and the American women were risking to get shut out of gold for the first time in the US Olympic history. The victory was somewhat overlooked at the time, but since the early 1990s, when the crimes of the Soviet Bloc started to unravel, their gold medal is often considered to be one of the most improbable and heroic upsets of all time. In track and field, both the US men's and women's team were overwhelmed by East Germans who, as their Soviet masters expected, stole away a bulk of medals from the US in its signature sports, thus allowing the Soviets to win the medal table virtually unchallenged. The US boxing team surprised everyone, advancing to six gold medal bouts and winning five of them, drawing parallels to a stellar 1952 team that also took 5 golds. The achievement was even more momentous due to the fact that the American boxers were significantly younger and less experienced than their Cuban and Soviet counterparts. In other sports, US divers won 5 medals, including two golds; the US equestrian team took home 4 medals; American shooters won three medals, including a historic silver by a woman in the mixed 50 meters rifle three positions; US freestyle wrestlers advanced to four gold medal bouts, yet won only one of them (all four were against the Soviets), concluding the meet with 6 medals overall.", "trgt": "The Eastern Bloc dominated the 1976 Montreal Olympics, with seven countries placing in the top ten of the medal table.
