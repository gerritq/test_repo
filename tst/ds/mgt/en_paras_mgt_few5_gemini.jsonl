In 1999, Lance Armstrong tested positive for corticoids. Armstrong explained that he had used an external ointment to treat a rash and produced a prescription. This was a violation of cycling rules, which state that prescriptions must be shown to sports authorities in advance. Sports authorities accepted this explanation and cleared Armstrong. Some cycling insiders have described the use of prescriptions unmotivated by medical needs, particularly of external corticoids, as a widespread practice. Therefore, it is difficult to determine whether this 1999 finding was a sign of doping."}
