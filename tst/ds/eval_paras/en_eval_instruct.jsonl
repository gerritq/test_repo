British Asiannon Muslim girls (Sikh or Hindu)suffered abuse that mirrored that of other victims, but there was a reluctance to report it due to the fear of shame and dishonour it would bring on their families. A \"common thread\" was that Muslim taxi drivers had been picking the children up for sex from care homes and schools.\"\"\""}

Paragraph:\n\n\"\"\"Jakob Grimm took up the question of Eostre in his Deutsche Mythologie of 1835, noting that Ostaramanoth was etymologically related to Eostremonat (Eosturmonath) and writing of various landmarks and customs related to the goddess Ostara in Germany. Again, because of a lack of written documentation, critics suggest that Grimm took Bede's mention of a goddess Eostre at face value and constructed the goddess Ostara around existing Germanic customs which may have arisen independently. Amongst other traditions, Grimm connected the 'Osterhase' (Easter Bunny) and Easter Eggs to the goddess Ostara/Eostre. He also cites various place names in Germany as being evidence of Ostara, but critics contend that the close etymological relationship between Ostara and the words for 'east' and 'dawn' could mean that these place names referred to either of those two things rather than a goddess.\"\"\""}

Paragraph:\n\n\"\"\"Nu metal (also called aggro metal) is a controversial musical genre derived from a movement in heavy metal music that began in the late 1990s. Nu metal typically fuses influences from the alternative rock of the early 1990s, hip-hop, and electronic music with various heavy metal styles in varying degrees and quantities. The popularity of such music in the late 1990s and early 2000s led to widespread negative associations with the phrase \"nu metal\", particularly due to commercialization, and many nu metal fans and artists reject the term, which has become almost an all-purpose musical insult.\"\"\""}

However, some philosophical perspectives argue that true control is elusive in a universe that includes elements considered supernatural or miraculous. This viewpoint suggests that individuals may feel at the mercy of forces beyond their understanding, leading to a perception of life as unpredictable. Proponents of this perspective argue that human consciousness should focus on tangible reality and the physical world, yet they contend that traditional moral teachings often emphasize the importance of transcending this earthly existence. These teachings may advocate for a focus on a higher reality that is perceived as inaccessible to reason and difficult to articulate, often achieved through spiritual practices or profound experiences. Additionally, there is a belief that self-esteem and personal pride in one's intellectual capabilities are sometimes viewed negatively within certain moral frameworks, which may prioritize humility and the recognition of human limitations.

One of the first fruits of the press had become realized by the printing of the Holy Bible; as translated by William Tyndale and other scholars. This knowledge, sowed by circulation throughout Europe and today’s United Kingdom, helped nurture the spirit that would pour the foundation of heart, mind and conscience, needed to support the great religious and political changes that would be reaped in the sixteenth century and beyond.\"\"\""}

Paragraph:\n\n\"\"\"Contrary to the opinion of Benjamin K. Sovacool, a major EU funded research study known as ExternE, or Externalities of Energy, undertaken over the period of 1995 to 2005 found that the cost of producing electricity from coal or oil would double over it's present value, and the cost of electricity production from gas would increase by 30% if external costs such as damage to the environment and to human health, from the Particulate matter, Nitrogen oxides, Chromium VI and Arsenic emissions produced by these sources, were taken into account. It was estimated in the study that these external, downstream, fossil fuel costs amount up to 1-2 % of the EU’s entire Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and this was before the external cost of global warming from these sources was even included. The study also found that the environmental and health costs of Nuclear power, per unit of energy delivered, was lower than many Renewable sources, including that caused by biomass and Photovoltaic solar panels, but was marginally higher than the external costs associated with Wind power and alpine Hydropower.\"\"\""}
